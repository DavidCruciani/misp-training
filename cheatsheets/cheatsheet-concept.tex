\cheatboxlarge{Glossary}{
    \boxentry{Correlations}{Are links created automatically whenever an \attribute is created or modified. They allow interconnection between \events based on their values.}
    \boxentry{Correlation Engine}{Is the system used by MISP to create correlation between \attribute's value. It currently support strict string comparison, SSDEEP and CDIR blocks matches.}
    \boxentry{Caching}{Is the process of \textit{fetching} data from a MISP instance or feed but only storing hashes of the collected values for correlations and look-ups purposes.}
    \boxentry{Delegation}{Is the act of transfering the ownership of an \event to another organisation and removing any associations with the original creator.}
    \boxentry{Deletion (hard/soft)}{\textit{Hard deletion} is the act of removing the element from the database. It will thus do not perform revocation on other MISP instances. \textit{Soft deletion} is the act flagging an element as deleted and thus propagating the revocation among the network of connected MISP instances.}
    \boxentry{Extended \event}{Is an \event that extends an existing \event, providing a combined view of the data contained in both \events. The owner of the extending \event is the organisation that created the extension, this allows anyone to extend any \events and have control over them.}
    \boxentry{\galaxy Matrix}{Is a matrix derived from \clusters belonging to the same \galaxy. The layout (pages and columns) is defined at the \galaxy level and its content comes from the \clusters meta-data themselves.}
    \boxentry{Indicators}{contain a pattern that can be used to detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity. They are generally \attributes having their \texttt{to\_ids} flag set.}
    \boxentry{Orgc / Org}{\textit{Creator Organisation} (\textbf{Orgc}) is the organisation that created the data and the one allowed to modify it. \textit{Owner Organisation} (\textbf{Org}) is the organisation owning the data on a given instance and is allowed to view it regardless of the distribution level.}
    \boxentry{Publishing}{Is the action of declaring that an \event is ready to be synchronised. It may also send e-mail notifications and make it available to some formats.}
    \boxentry{Pulling}{Is the action of using a user on a remote instance to fetch the accessible data and store it locally.}
    \boxentry{Pushing}{Is the action of using an uplink connection via a \textit{sync. user} to send data to a remote instance.}
    \boxentry{Synchronisation}{Is the exchange of data between two (or more) MISP instances throught the \textit{pull} and \textit{push} mechanism.}
    \boxentry{Sync. filtering rule}{Can be applied on a synchronisation link for both the \textit{pull} and \textit{push} mechanisms to block or allow the data to be transfered.}
    \boxentry{Sync. User}{Special role of a user granting addional sync permissions. The recommanded way to setup \textit{pull} and \textit{push} synchronisation is to use \textit{sync users}.}
    \boxentry{Proposals}{Are a mechanism to propose modications to the creating organisations. If a path of connected MISP instances exists, it will be synchronized so that the creator may accept or discard it.}

\cheatboxlarge[The act of \textbf{sharing} where everyone can be a consumer and/or a producer.]{Synchronisation}{
    A one way synchronisation link between two MISP instances. Organisation $\alpha$ created a \textit{sync user} \faicon{user-plus} on MISP 2 and noted down the generated API Key. A synchronisation link can be created on MISP 1 using the API Key and the organisation of the \textit{sync user}. At that point, MISP 1 can \textit{pull} data from MISP 2 and \textit{push} data to MISP 2.
