  \frametitle{We have a massive rework of the MISP internals planned}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Upgrade to a more {\bf modern version of the framework} (CakePHP 3.x paving the way to 4.x)
    \item Move to a more {\bf modern UI} (Bootstrap 4 based)
    \item Good moment to rid ourselves of a LOT of {\bf legacy} baggage
    \item Some of the work has already started behind the scenes
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Some things that will change}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item First time we'll have a {\bf manual upgrade} to a new version of MISP since ~2015
    \begin{itemize}
      \item This means you'll get an upgrade script that needs to be executed, MISP made unavailable during the upgrade
      \item {\bf All sync / modern APIs will be compatible between the old/new versions}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Raising the requirements of the supported language versions ({\bf PHP 7.2+, Python 3.6+})
    \item CakePHP 3.x's backend is quite different, so we'll use the opportunity for a refactor
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What this will mean for users}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Leaner and {\bf more performant} MISP 
    \item Cuttig down on a lot of long {\bf deprecated} baggage
    \item Sleeker UI
    \item One of our planned improvements is to be able to run MISP in two separate modes of operation ({\bf endpoint vs sharing hub})
    \begin{itemize}
      \item MISP is built as a shared use system from the ground up
      \item We see many use cases where it's used as an endpoint/internal tool
      \item We want to reduce the burden on these installations
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The current plan for the whole process}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Tying off loose ends
    \item Preparation phase
    \item Transition phase
    \item Post release support
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Tying off loose ends}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We are currently busy with finishing off a set of features that are high priority first
    \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf "Zoidberg"} \item first/last seen with time based correlation
      \item Modular {\bf feed parsing}
      \item Markdown based {\bf reports} attached to events
      \item Working through a stockpile of {\bf pull requests}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Preparation phase}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This phase can be handled in {\bf parallel to other tasks}, so generally business as usual
    \item We welcome community members to join us for this effort
    \item Simplify a lot of the backend code, switch to a light-weight middleware that interfaces with both cake 2.x/3.x and that makes building new functionalities simpler with MISP in mind
    \item get rid of the inconsistent current view system and move to generated views (we have already migrated parts of the UI over the past few months)
    \item A good moment to re-evaluate some decisions we've made and improve the consistency / simplicity of the code-base
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Transition phase}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This is where the {\bf real transition will happen}, we want to move our ORM and UI generators to the new framework
    \item The preparation phase's output is what should make this a quick transition
    \item During this phase we will halt the development of new features
    \item Two branches of MISP in parallel, 2.4 will enter bug fix only mode
    \item We estimate this phase to be rather short, our plan is to try to cram it in about ~1-2 month
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Post release support}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We will {\bf keep supporting the old version of MISP} for a short duration after the release
    \item Two MISP versions operational in parallel
    \item MISP 2.4 will not receive any new features any longer and will be on {\bf life support}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Other new things planned in upcoming releases}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item As part of the {\bf VARIOT} project, add the ability to export feeds in MISP and publish them to {\bf open data} directories
    \item Work has begun on the next big leap for the feed system: working with feed providers to have their offerings directly available through MISP
    \item The system incorporated for the decaying of indicators has been a rapid success - thanks to all the feedback we will be incorporating a host of changes
    \item We are evaluating models to offer professional support for those users that require it
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Cerebrate}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Another {\bf OSS tool} meant to help us build organisation registries
    \item Communities can run centralised installations and/or use the one provided by the misp-project
    \item Opt-in system for organisations, communities
    \item Repositories of signing keys for event signing
    \item Add a list of MISP instances to your cerebrate's {\bf brood}
    \item Create sync requests to {\bf simplify the process of interconnecting with trusted peers}
    \item Link up trusted Cerebrates to {\bf join a swarm with your brood}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
