1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,719
and I'll pass over the mic all right

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,278
thank you

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,599
yeah great, good morning good afternoon

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:12,719
and even good evening for some of you

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,879
um so um i'm really glad and uh

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,480
we are glad to present about MISP today

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,719
and so it's a

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,240
double series of workshops so we start

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,799
with a workshop of the introduction and

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,799
we go

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,839
more deeper tomorrow in that second 

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
workshop

13
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,359
um i'm alexander noah I do work for

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,640
CIRCL and

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,800
i work in the MISP {inaudible}

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,520
so today uh the agenda is the following

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,78
uh we will do a quick introduction to

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,920
MISP

19
00:00:38,79 --> 00:00:43,679
a kind of of one-hour sessions with

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,239
all the detail about MISP and then a

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,359
more like kind of usage deep dive

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:52,558
of one hour where we do hands-on together

23
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:55,519
um for the logistic aspect um

24
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,839
in the chat room we will share with you

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
uh

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,520
all the details how to access the MISP

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,399
instance so during the sessions in the

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,239
workshop

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,840
you can connect to a dedicated MISP

30
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,840
system that we set up for you

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
and this one will be used for all the

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,79
hands-on that we will

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,240
we do as I just mentioned we have a

34
00:01:10,79 --> 00:01:14,158
small short break of 15 minutes

35
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,679
and then we will continue in the end

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960
{inaudible}

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,880
depending of how far we are today uh

38
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,959
we will maybe talk about the community

39
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,719
building aspect but this is a topic for

40
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,239
tomorrow obviously

41
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,640
but if we have some time remaining we

42
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,280
might uh talk about this and then we

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,920
have a

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
q&a sessions uh to discuss about the

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,359
different {inaudible} and so on

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,439
so don't hesitate to to put your

47
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,438
question to zoom

48
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,319
uh directly and we will try to answer live

50
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,600
all those questions that you are asking  

51
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,599
during uh during this session

52
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,239
so first of all welcome all as well from

53
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,519
me so i'm Andras Iklody i'm

54
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:56,798
also working at CIRCL working on MISP

55
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,280
um to just kick things off um I think

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,719
it's a good

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,79
good moment to start a little bit about

58
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,78
the history of how this whole thing

59
00:02:00,78 --> 00:02:04,879
started how MISP came about

60
00:02:02,78 --> 00:02:06,839
so just a quick introduction of where we

61
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,519
came from and where where we are

62
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,399
nowadays uh initially this whole thing

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,520
for us with MISP

64
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,959
started as part of a of a series of

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,360
incidents that we had in

66
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,759
back in 2012 between national and

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,480
military CSIRTS at the time

68
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,799
where we were basically investigating umattacks

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
that were hitting several of the

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
institutions at the at the time

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
and one of the interesting things that

73
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,759
we found was that even though we had

74
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
something called the malware analysis

75
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,120
working group which was this which is a

76
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,360
group that was regularly meeting and

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,680
discussing ongoing incidents

78
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,720
we still had a massive gap in between

79
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,80
those meetings

80
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,318
where everyone was working in their own

81
00:02:42,80 --> 00:02:45,920
silo on basically the same attack and

82
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,759
and doing reverse engineering of the

83
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,0
165.92 --> 170
same attacks without

84
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,439
having the ways, the means or the processes

86
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,39
to directly share with our peers so we

87
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,919
ended up with a lot of duplication of

88
00:02:55,39 --> 00:02:57,759
work which ended

89
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,199
which was obviously frustrating from uh

90
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,439
for many of us

91
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,598
so Christophe Vandeplas at the time he

92
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,318
was working at the belgian

93
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,399  
ministry of defense um in his free time

94
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,318
wrote a platform called {inaudible}

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,519
that later on ended up becoming MISP so

96
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,280
the initial idea was

97
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,800
really for reverse engineers to share

98
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,439
the output of their work directly with

99
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,719
their peers

100
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:22,158
in a hosted platform and since then

101
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,158
obviously MISP has evolved and changed

102
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,840
the scope of what we were nowadays doing

103
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,798
with MISP and what sort of information

104
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,640
we're sharing

105
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
but it all started with this and since

106
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,878
then it has been an ongoing effort

107
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,199
basically by

108
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,199
a large community of different

109
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,359
requirements and different needs

110
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,359
and that has been building both the

111
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,159
ideas that go into MISP as well as the

112
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
software itself

113
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,839
next slide please

114
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,919
yeah so what is the background and why

115
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,839
we are doing

116
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,79
MISP it uh I think like Andras

117
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
mentioned it started from a with a kind

118
00:03:56,80 --> 00:03:59,40
of

119
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,479
{inaudible} project for a small set of

120
00:03:59,39 --> 00:04:03,598
CIRCL

121
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,959
CIRCL is nowadays

122
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,359
the CERT for the private sector, the

123
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,959
community {inaudible} in luxembourg

124
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,200
and we basically deal with the

125
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,158
development of MISP not only for our use

126
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,359
case but for many

127
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:18,319
different users so we are called as

128
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,439
a CERT we basically operate the

129
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,478
development and we operate

130
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,478
{inaudible} communities

131
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,960
so a little bit about our involvement

132
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,478
and

133
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,79
why we're doing this in the first place

134
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,560
so we as CIRCL we're funded by the

135
00:04:30,79 --> 00:04:35,680
Ministry of Economy to basically build

136
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,600
security for the private sector uh and a

137
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,199
lot of what we do involves uh open

138
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
source software development so we're

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,160
basically

140
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,79
the funding that we get for the uh for

141
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,199
activities also cover our development

142
00:04:44,79 --> 00:04:47,918
focus

143
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,360
we're also uh besides just building the

144
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,159
tools like {inaudible} mentioned we're

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,479
also

146
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,919
basically involved in a lot of sharing

147
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,839
activities as well as our day-to-day

148
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,399
operations we're users of the

149
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,478
tool primarily as well we basically host

150
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,719
a bunch of different communities for the

151
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,439
uh national C-Certs for the

152
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,919
luxembourgish private sector community

153
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,680
for law enforcement uh organizations

154
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,959
financial institutions and so on and so

155
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,319
forth

156
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,239
so so we're kind of uh

157
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,240
in the game on both sides so to say that

158
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,120
both as a

159
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,0
318.24 --> 322
producer and as a consumer, also and the

160
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,79
project was

161
00:05:22,0 --> 00:05:25,759
322 --> 325.759
co-financed by the European Union

162
00:05:24,79 --> 00:05:29,120
under the CEF project

163
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,400
uh so this is also one of the sources of

164
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
the income that we got basically to

165
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,560
build the tool and as a FIRST member you

166
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,79
have access to a MISP instance that is

167
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,478
operated and

168
00:05:36,79 --> 00:05:40,0
336.08 --> 340
co-maintained by FIRST and CIRCL that

169
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,680
you can get access to

170
00:05:40,0 --> 00:05:43,519
340 --> 343.52
so you just need to to use your

171
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,680
traditional credential or

172
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,359
access at first and you get access to

173
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,600
this instance with information

174
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,439
that you can use and so on we will talk

175
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,160
about that later on

176
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,600
so the main question and I think it's

177
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,80
coming from this story uh

178
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
as Andras mentioned from the early days

179
00:05:58,79 --> 00:06:01,758
MISP was

180
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,840
focusing from a very specific aspect

181
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,120
which was malware reversing and so on

182
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,799
nowadays it's a threat intelligence sharing platforms we

183
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,38
are basically sharing any kind of

184
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,38
intelligence through uh through MISP

185
00:06:11,38 --> 00:06:14,478
um because we had an evolution of the

186
00:06:13,38 --> 00:06:16,399
time for the different things so

187
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,879
and our main goals and that's very

188
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,439
important for us it's an open source

189
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,120
software so that means MISP will always

190
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,519
remain an open source project we even

191
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,0
383.12 --> 386
take

192
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,879
some decisions within the project to

193
00:06:26,0 --> 00:06:29,120
386 --> 389.12
keep it as

194
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,639
open source and that's that's really a

195
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,720
key for us so it's really uh

196
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,800
something that you can download yourself

197
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,39
run on your infrastructure and so on

198
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
you can really have the full control on

199
00:06:37,38 --> 00:06:40,639
the software stack

200
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,0
398.24 --> 402
when you are using MISP and one of the

201
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,38
goals of the software itself is to

202
00:06:42,0 --> 00:06:46,240
402 --> 406.24
collect information

203
00:06:43,38 --> 00:06:48,159
from other partners, from in the {inaudible}

204
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
from automatic tools from different

205
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,800
fields and so on

206
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,198
that was really one of the initial goal

207
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,680
of MISP is like being able to collect

208
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,360
to get all this information into

209
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,38
one place

210
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,560
and then afterwards what you can do with

211
00:06:59,38 --> 00:07:02,719
it is to normalize

212
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,839
correlate this information, extend the

213
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,560
information and enrich

214
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,879
information with more information and then

216
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,800
really benefit from the sharing aspect

217
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,120
of MISP and you can allow

218
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,840
teams and community to collaborate

219
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,478
and we have

220
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,318
seen MISP for example use not only

221
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,159
within different organizations but even

222
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,759
within a single organization you can, for

223
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
example run multiple MISP

224
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,120
to collaborate directly on different

225
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,79
investigations

226
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,519
incidents and cases and obviously when

227
00:07:28,79 --> 00:07:31,279
you have all this information and all

228
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,758
these analytic platform into MISP

229
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,638
you are ready to use this information to

230
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,960
for example

231
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,840
feed your automatic protective tools

232
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,0
456.96 --> 462
like intrusion detection systems,

233
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,279
firewalls whatever and to feed

234
00:07:42,0 --> 00:07:45,598
462 --> 465.599
automatically those

235
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,799
information to basically make protective

236
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,319
measures

237
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,319
in your environment

238
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,840
so, start from the starting point that we

239
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,680
already mentioned basically how we

240
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,638
started out with MISP

241
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,800
let's have a quick look at how uh the

242
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,400
user base of MISP evolved in terms of

243
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,0
482.8 --> 486
the different types of stakeholders

244
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,560
within our own organizations and other organizations

246
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,319
the reason for that is obviously that

247
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,560
this drives the development process as well

249
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,400
so the way MISP grows over time really

250
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
depends on the type of users that are using

252
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:18,319
the type of users that are requesting new

253
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,159
features or that are providing pull

254
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,639
requests on the project and providing code

256
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,759
for the project so I said before

257
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,160
initially

258
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,759
the scope of MISP was very limited it

259
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,360
was basically just the output of malware

260
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,199
reversers which meant

261
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,479
raw indicators that we were extracting

262
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,560
during the process and that we're

263
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,639
sharing directly

264
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,79
with our partners, this meant very little

265
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,519
analysis was done on each of these

266
00:08:38,80 --> 00:08:41,599
individual indicators there was very

267
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,440
little information in terms of

268
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,200
of why those data points are relevant in

269
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,360
the long term how they are meant to be used

271
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,519
from detection perspective they were

272
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,480
really just the raw output

273
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,0
529.519 --> 534
from the analysis process or the

274
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,80
reversing process

275
00:08:54,0 --> 00:08:57,519
534 --> 537.519
now one of the side effects of this when

276
00:08:56,80 --> 00:08:59,440
you start building a collection within

277
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,360
your organization of this information

278
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,880
the security analysts are feeding your

279
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,320
various protective tools become

280
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,838
interested in that data set

281
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,0
544.32 --> 548
because obviously whatever is targeting

282
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,160
your organization or your direct peers

283
00:09:08,0 --> 00:09:11,360
548 --> 551.36
are probably the most relevant piece of

284
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,39
information that you can use for

285
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,159
detection

286
00:09:13,39 --> 00:09:19,39
so one of the first steps that we opened

288
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,479
up to was basically involving our own

289
00:09:19,39 --> 00:09:23,278
security analyst with our

290
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,320
own organizations so they can hook

291
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,360
the output of

292
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,80
of the reverse engineering team

293
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,360
up to their SIEMs to their IDSs to

294
00:09:30,80 --> 00:09:33,360
their firewalls

295
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,440
and to feed this data directly into

296
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,720
their protective measures

297
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,720
now one of the interesting things when

298
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,800
you start doing that though is that you

299
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,560
generate a new type of output which is

300
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,559
timeliness for the data, freshness for

301
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,838
the data as well as feedback on how

302
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,838
useful the data was

303
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,240
so we're very often when you're

304
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,40
extracting information

305
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,360
by sandboxing for example a lot of the

306
00:09:53,39 --> 00:09:57,679
data generated will be noise in the end

307
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,759
and this noise will generate false

308
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,159
positive alerts for example

309
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,319
in your detection tools. Now feeding this

310
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,559
information back

311
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,559
to data gave it a whole new type of value

313
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,159
we had freshness so if an older

314
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,159
indicator was reused

315
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,439
over time we saw that that is still

316
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,160
something that is actively to be monitored

318
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,838
and if we saw that something turned out

319
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,199
to be a cleaned up host

320
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,440
in the meanwhile or something was a

321
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
false positive from the get-go

322
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,399
we could feed that information back as well

324
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,759
so suddenly once you have timeliness as

325
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,759
well as the the raw data itself

326
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,278
you get the intelligence analyst

327
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,399
interested that are tracking the

328
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:42,0
movements and the changes of how attackers operate

330
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,639
uh over time so that means that usually

332
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,199
back then especially in 2012 in most of our

333
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,560
organizations the people that are doing

334
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,560
intelligence and the people that were

335
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,239
doing operations and security for the

336
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,680
operations were usually working in their own silos

338
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,40
so while there was obviously interaction

339
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,958
between the teams, it was not as

340
00:10:57,39 --> 00:11:01,919
ingrained to work together

341
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,599
between those type of roles but this

342
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,0
661.92 --> 664
changed over time and one of the changes

344
00:11:04,0 --> 00:11:08,78
664 --> 668.079
that we saw happened was that the output

345
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
of what the security analysts

346
00:11:08,78 --> 00:11:12,159
and the reversers and the analysts were

347
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,480
outputting basically from the operation side

349
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,399
became more and more interesting for the

350
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,839
intelligence analysts that meant that

351
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,919
if they were tracking a certain threat

352
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,600
actor and they could attribute certain

353
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,439
actions that they were seen in the

354
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,519
network of the organization

355
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,959
to the certain threat actor they could

356
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,278
monitor for example how

357
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,879
the given actor was changing how fast

358
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,78
they were changing infrastructure

359
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,0
690.88 --> 694
whether they were switching up their

360
00:11:32,78 --> 00:11:36,78
methodology and this

361
00:11:34,0 --> 00:11:37,519
694 --> 697.519
gave them a lot of idea of useful data

362
00:11:36,78 --> 00:11:39,199
of improving their libraries of the

363
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,799
threat actors that they were tracking

364
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,920
so suddenly we got this group interests

365
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,838
as well and they were obviously

366
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,879
producing data as well so nowadays if

367
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,279
you look at MISP

368
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,200
going from a raw indicator sharing platform

369
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,399
that MISP was initially

370
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,160
nowadays you have a lot of the high

371
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,759
level threat intel information included

372
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,720
with the data as well so you will see threat reports

374
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,720
you will see interconnected information

375
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:04,399
about threat actors modus operandi

377
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,79
infrastructure impact and so on so forth

378
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,360
these extra layers of information that

379
00:12:06,78 --> 00:12:08,719
we were missing initially

380
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,0
727.36 --> 730
so this was the biggest change that we

381
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,440
had over time within our own

382
00:12:10,0 --> 00:12:13,919
730 --> 733.92
organizations but

383
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,519
obviously as a CSIRT that has

384
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,199
different constituencies

385
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,799
we're also interacting with the security

386
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
teams of other organizations and one of

387
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,319
the things we noticed early on was

388
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,160
there's a lot of the issues that other

389
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
types of organizations had internally

390
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,800
with information sharing are very similar to ours

392
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,958
so initially the first use case that we

393
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,799
got that was different and from our

394
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,719
normal security use case

395
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,399
was basically the various financial

396
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,920
organizations reaching out to us saying

397
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,759
that their fraud teams were

398
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,599
running into similar sort of issues with

399
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,759
sharing between their teams,

400
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,839
sharing with other partner teams,

401
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,319
information about mule accounts and

402
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,519
about other fraud related information

403
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,680
so they reached out to us and

404
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,480
basically their security teams reached

405
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,199
out to us and said

406
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,639
can't we just try to help them also

407
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,0
777.2 --> 780
to share that sort of information

408
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,759
through MISP directly, I mean we already

409
00:13:00,0 --> 00:13:03,200
780 --> 783.2
had the tooling in place

410
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,200
it was just a question of changing the data model

412
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,639
so we we started doing that for uh together

413
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,480
with the financial sector initially

414
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,0
788.639 --> 792
where we expanded the data model of MISP

415
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,519
when we allowed for modeling of new

416
00:13:12,0 --> 00:13:15,919
792 --> 795.92
custom data types

417
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,679
and it's even surprising to us at the

418
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,319
time turned into a success

419
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,599
very rapidly so nowadays we're involved

420
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,959
with quite a few different types of

421
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,519
organizations out there

422
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,879
replicating the same scenario where for

423
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,320
example law enforcement, where we initially had

425
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,79
mostly contact with their security teams

426
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,240
and helping them build data sets for bootstrapping their forensic

429
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,480
investigations nowadays we have all

430
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,959
sorts of information sharing involving

431
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,278
uh for example uh seized goods information sharing from

433
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,799
border control agencies uh law enforcement agencies

435
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,120
sharing information about passenger information

436
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,359
so a lot of the type of data

437
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,360
sharing that was very unusual for us as

438
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,79
a CSIRT initially

439
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,879
now once you get all this data in a

440
00:13:58,78 --> 00:14:01,39
system and you

441
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,399
started building a data set from your community

443
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,79
you start to see trends in the data set

444
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,839
and this is what gets

445
00:14:06,78 --> 00:14:09,759
for example our risk analysis team

446
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
interested in it the moment that you're

447
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,639
seeing how attackers are changing their

448
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,199
trends over time

449
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,719
you can better advise your constituency your customers and so on

451
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,160
about the different risks that they might be facing and the

453
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,879
different risks that they should be preparing for

455
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,958
and preparing the organizations for

456
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,519
based on what the same sector is facing

457
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,359
perhaps in the same geographic location

458
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,120
so suddenly you get a lot of knowledge

459
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,120
out of the collected data as long as

460
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
data is well contextualized and I think

461
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,78
this will be one of the main topics that

462
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,519
we're going to be talking about quite a bit today and tomorrow

464
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,599
is contextualizing the information and

465
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,600
making the information actually usable

466
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
and turning data really into knowledge

467
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,40
yeah so like Andras mentioned

468
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
we have a pretty large set of different

469
00:14:55,39 --> 00:15:00,0
895.04 --> 900
communities using MISP

470
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,159
and over the time it became I think more

471
00:15:00,0 --> 00:15:03,759
900 --> 903.76
complicated to handle all those requests

472
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,120
from different organizations

473
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:10,0
903.76 --> 910
um so we came with a model of governance

474
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,240
even if it's a very lightweight one we

475
00:15:10,0 --> 00:15:13,839
910 --> 913.839
decided to have this kind of models to

476
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
still benefit from the open source

477
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,199
community model and then

478
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,278
bring all the experience from a

479
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,198
different community into systems where

480
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,720
it allows us to develop and extend the

481
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,958
software so we decided to

482
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,240
create this kind of models where we

483
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,879
basically

484
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,320
take care of all the features and

485
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,679
requests that we receive from different organizations

487
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,599
so we use this kind of priority list of different features

489
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,720
and we get that feedback from {inaudible}

491
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,879
one of the {inaudible} one I would say is

492
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,480
Github so we get the feed from

493
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,399
the different issue that we receive from

494
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,639
Github I mean on the if you look at on

495
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,320
Github you'll see that we have a

496
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,320
significant number of issues and those

497
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,800
issue are usually for us a way to track down

499
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,879
all the different requests of features

500
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,120
in MISP and that's one way to get it.

501
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,639
Another way and this one is a quite a common one

503
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,39
is basically a training or session like

504
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,799
this where people are providing feedback,

505
00:16:05,39 --> 00:16:09,39
bug reports, future requests and so on

506
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,879
directly during the training and for us

507
00:16:09,39 --> 00:16:12,958
uh I think really practical and we can

508
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,39
get all this information needed for us

509
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,0
972.959 --> 976
to improve the software. Another thing

510
00:16:15,39 --> 00:16:17,759
that we do and

511
00:16:16,0 --> 00:16:19,839
976 --> 979.839
that's maybe for the audience some

512
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,39
people are interested in that one

513
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,560
we know that there are plenty of

514
00:16:21,39 --> 00:16:24,399
different MISP of groups that we don't

515
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:28,319
control and that we don't manage that's

516
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,679
great we have for example ISACs, ISAO

517
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,360
doing really those kind of things where

518
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,838
you have those kind of user groups

519
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,600
and what we do we participate on a

520
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,279
regular basis to one of those groups for

521
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,0
995.6 --> 998
example on a quarterly basis on a yearly basis

523
00:16:38,0 --> 00:16:41,759
998 --> 1001.759
and we do a collection of requirements

524
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,240
from those different groups

525
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,720
during one session and that's really

527
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,799
i think useful for us because it's a way

528
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
to to gather information so for example

529
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,78
Andras mentioned those

530
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,519
financial groups where people are

531
00:16:52,78 --> 00:16:54,559
sharing information about bank account

532
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,480
detail and so on

533
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,919
and that's where we basically gather all

534
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,278
those requirements

535
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,39
so if you are setting up a group

536
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,278
somewhere in US or

537
00:17:01,39 --> 00:17:04,318
in the world about sharing information

538
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,0
1023.279 --> 1026
and so on and you want to

539
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,759
invite us at some point in time it's a

540
00:17:06,0 --> 00:17:12,160
1026 --> 1028.959
way for us to gather those kind of requirements

542
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,759
we do a summit which is a yearly event

543
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
usually it was physical but nowadays

544
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,0
1033.76 --> 1038
it's virtual trainings

545
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,918
so it's basically every user or

546
00:17:18,0 --> 00:17:21,199
1038 --> 1041.199
organizations using MISP presenting what

547
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,959
they are doing

548
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,558
it's a way for us to to see the

549
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,480
interactions and see what

550
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,480
can be improved in MISP and see {inaudible}

551
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,759
in the community behind

552
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,839
and then we have a kind of 20%

553
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,200
project around in MISP

554
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:38,558
1051.84 --> 1056
where we design new functionalities and we test

556
00:17:36,0 --> 00:17:39,919
1056 --> 1059.919
them out for example one of those is the

557
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,200
detailing of indicators

558
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,400
which was a request from different

559
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,919
organizations but it was kind of

560
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,919
difficult to design

561
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,240
and with this kind of models where we

562
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,480
designed first as a kind of prototype

563
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,558
multiple iterations uh we did a multiple

564
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,0
1070.48 --> 1076
research paper on that and then finally

565
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,918
this become part of the MISP core software

566
00:17:56,0 --> 00:17:59,679
1076 --> 1079.679
we will show that later on but so we

567
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,679
have a lightweight governance model

568
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,840
but really the goal is to gather as

569
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,280
much feedback from the user so don't

570
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,599
hesitate if you have any bug reports, ideas and so on

571
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,319
either open an issue,

573
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,918
get in touch with us.

575
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,400
You are more than welcome to basically

576
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,399
share such kind of information.

577
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,719
Yeah, now addressing the elephant in the room

579
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,160
when you bring so many different

580
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,759
organizations together and build a large

581
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,200
community of sharing with different

582
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,558
needs and requirements

583
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
you're obviously going to have to run

584
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,720
into conflicting requirements as well

585
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,240
so one of the most obvious ones that

586
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,640
that we're dealing with very often with

587
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,720
information sharing and something that

588
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,840
that we're working on tackling ,

590
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:43,599
basically since we started with MISP, is dealing

591
00:18:42,79 --> 00:18:45,279
with a different requirement of

592
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,879
of what you count as valuable

593
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,519
information depending on your use case

594
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,599
so this is different also within 

596
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,360
different analysts, different roles

597
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,79
within the same organization as

598
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:58,720
well so for example, for us as a CSIRT in general

600
00:18:57,38 --> 00:19:00,240
uh detection is the most important

601
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,640
matter so we're interested

602
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:08,880
in in using indicators to detect if our constituency

604
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,0
1146.88 --> 1150
is affected by something that the

605
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,880
information is being

606
00:19:10,0 --> 00:19:14,160
1150 --> 1154.16
shared about or whether uh any of the

607
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,200
the infrastructure that we're

608
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,840
responsible for is infected 

609
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,639
on the other hand if you're talking to an isp

611
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,640
one of the large

612
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
requirements from an isp basically will

613
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,38
be able to protect their users

614
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,79
from potential harm so that means that

616
00:19:30,79 --> 00:19:34,480
if there are any urls, websites, and so on

618
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,480
that they should block for their users they

619
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,679
need to be able to generate a block list

620
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,440
out of the data

621
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,600
that is considered to be malicious

622
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,360
enough now if you compare these two use cases

623
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,240
with each other detection versus blocking

625
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,359
you will immediately see that the effect

627
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,359
of having a false positive in the data

628
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,160
set or data that is no longer fresh

629
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,119
has a completely different impact 

630
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,960
sure for us when

631
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,719
that are mostly in the detection game

632
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,400
it's annoying we get a false positive

633
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,400
alert it has to be handled

634
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,759
and it takes time and effort it also

635
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,200
introduces something called alert fatigue

636
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,319
that i'm sure many of you are familiar with

638
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,79
if you're getting a lot of false

639
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,120
positive alerts you're more likely to ignore the

641
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,798
next alert that you get but besides that

642
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,879
it has no real operational impact on us 

644
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,879
on the other hand for an isp that ends up blocking

645
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,880
something that is uh

646
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,400
potentially a false positive might have a catastrophic impact

648
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,600
imagine if someone accidentally, for example shares

650
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:35,759
facebook.com as an indicator that might

651
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:39,119
basically cause a riot with their users or it might {inaudible}

653
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,519
but it's a different story

654
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,479
but with that in mind, you see that these

655
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:47,679
two use cases are already conflicting

656
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,360
now if you also take the perspective of

657
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,400
intelligence analysts that are tracking

658
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,798
threat actor movements in to account 

660
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,400
that's an even more lax use case 

662
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,159
where you care about whether something is a fresh indicator still or not

664
00:21:00,79 --> 00:21:03,439
even less than the other two groups.

665
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,880
The reason for that is you're interested in

666
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,120
the historical movements of a threat actor, for example.

668
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,439
So even if something is no longer

669
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,38
an indicator because and an infected

670
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,960
website was cleaned up

671
00:21:13,38 --> 00:21:17,38
since the time when the indicator was

672
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,880
shared they still want to see

673
00:21:17,38 --> 00:21:20,558
how long, for example a threat actor was

674
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,80
using that infrastructure,

675
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,119
how quickly they changed to something

676
00:21:22,79 --> 00:21:27,519
else and what methods they used

677
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,239
back when they were exploiting it. 

679
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,839
So if you bring these different requirements on board on

680
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,959
the same platform is difficult and there are some

682
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,960
things that we can do to alleviate these

683
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,720
issues. For example what we do with

684
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,798
MISP

685
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,480
we have a system called warning list

686
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,480
system that allows us to filter out

687
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,640
obvious false positives

688
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:54,798
so we maintain these lists of

689
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,720
most common websites, empty hash lists,

690
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,319
public dns resolvers and all these

691
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,558
typical things that end up in

692
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:04,399
the sets while doing automatic extraction for example

694
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,80
that end up being false positives but

695
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,720
with that said this is just one part of the story

697
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,79
So if you're looking at the different

698
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,880
use cases up there that doesn't solve our issue

700
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,600
of having different requirements

701
00:22:14,0 --> 00:22:17,558
1334 --> 1336.559
from the data set based on what you do with it

703
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,319
and this is where contextualization

704
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,158
becomes more important again

705
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,0
1340.32 --> 1344
if we can supply the information together with the data,

707
00:22:23,0 --> 00:22:26,880
1344 --> 1346.88
why this data is relevant and what context you're

708
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,640
supposed to be using it

709
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,480
then the consumers of the data can make

710
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,440
those decisions for themselves based on

711
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,279
whatever they want to use

712
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,640
the data for in any of those different use cases

714
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,720
so one of our main efforts with MISP has been

716
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,0
1360.72 --> 1364
to be able to provide these different

717
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,519
structures together with the data and to

718
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:48,519
1364 --> 1367.52
be able to label data well enough. Back to you. 

720
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,720
Yeah so and that's iI think important regarding the

721
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,720
different kind of use cases and so on

722
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,360
and we try to support those different use cases and

725
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,679
that's sometimes challenging for us but luckily

726
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,320
we are at the same time

727
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,840
part of various community so we can see

728
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,279
the different use cases, especially

729
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:13,480
regarding the handling of false positive which is

731
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,558
an ongoing challenge but we will show

732
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,840
you how to handle that

733
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,0
1396.559 --> 1400
and at the same time we basically

734
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,79
operate those different communities.

735
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:24,159
1400 --> 1404.159
So for example we operate a pretty large

736
00:23:22,79 --> 00:23:26,798
one for the private sector

737
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,559
where we have a lot of organizations,

739
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,158
more than 1200 organizations are basically connected there.

740
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,440
It's pretty large and we see an active

742
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,400
community sharing information and

743
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,400
there is plenty of different communities

744
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,840
some that we don't know even about

745
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,278
because you can even run your own

746
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,558
private communities without telling anyone, that's fine.


748
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,759
That's part of the system but if you want to have different kind of communities

750
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:55,839
you can connect those automatically then you have I would say

753
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,798
different kind of model you have those kind of

755
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,480
fully island mode communities. 

756
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,679
Those kind of trusted groups so for example for the 

758
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:05,519
intelligence community it's very common for them to run MISP

759
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:09,759
in an island mode so having air gap system and so on

761
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,919
sometimes they are partially connected

762
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:13,599
with third parties to share partial

763
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,400
information so for example we know some organizations

765
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,640
or for example border controls or customs

767
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,919
are using MISP but they still need to

768
00:24:20,79 --> 00:24:24,319
share some small information and that

770
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,158
partially connected system. 

771
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:28,0
1464.32 --> 1468
MISP freely supports those kind of models

772
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,679
and then you have community that are

773
00:24:28,0 --> 00:24:31,359
1468 --> 1471.36
more broad and more large

774
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,278
for example in the financial sector and

775
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,240
I think the CSIRT Luxembourg has some banks

777
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,599
we are involved in various sharing communities

779
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,519
at European level and worldwide level

780
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,759
where for example we know some ISACs that are dedicated to

782
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,200
the financial sector are using it as a sharing mechanism 

784
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,278
you have some organizations that are really

785
00:24:49,38 --> 00:24:52,480
dedicated to a payment processing system

786
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,519
that are using this to share automatically

788
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,519
information and so on or analysis

790
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,519
One of the I would say pretty large community too is

791
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,960
with the military organization and international organizations

793
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,720
FIRST for example, you have a lot of FIRST members using

794
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,639
MISP for sharing their information

796
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,759
but there are plenty of networks, national governmental networks

798
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,278
a military one intelligence, one or even NATO for example are using

800
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,599
using MISP so maybe some of you are eligible to access those ones

802
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,399
so we have on the MISP an interface a way to connect to those

804
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,240
community and you can reach out to the

805
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,200
different community by asking for access for example

807
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,319
then you have very specific communities

808
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,720
that are set up by security vendors it's not uncommon

810
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,759
tp see for example a security vendor

811
00:25:34,0 --> 00:25:37,359
1534 --> 1537.36
services their own MISP

812
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,119
we have seen for example some

813
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,319
{inaudible} agents vendors running a dedicated MISP

815
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,480
or even some operators of specific cloud

816
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,400
services running a MISP instance

817
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,360
to share information amongst

818
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,320
their different customers.

819
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,798
Then you have communities that are

820
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:55,38
i would say very specific on the topic

821
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:59,79
for example you have about sick information uh false news

823
00:25:58,79 --> 00:26:02,278
and stuff like that you have communities doing that

825
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,720
for example we cooperate one called the COVID-19 MISP

827
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,839
which is really targeting COVID-19 as a topic 

828
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,720
and then you have 10 different subtopics like 

829
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,399
cyber security, health related topics and so on.

831
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,679
So you can see that MISP can be really used on

832
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,440
different model of communities

833
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,440
you can bridge those communities,

834
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,360
you can interconnect those with together,

835
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,759
you can keep it for yourself, so it's

836
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,839
really a matter of models.

837
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,759
Worldwide there are I would say a lot of

838
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:31,199
communities that we are not aware of

839
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,599
but we as CIRCL operates

840
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,120
around 20 communities nowadays, that you

841
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,839
can basically get access

842
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,839
and Andras just sharing in the chat the

843
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:42,439
access to the COVID-19 MISP and if you want to get access to

845
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,320
that one you can connect on the main page and self-register and

847
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,519
you can request access to that community 

849
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,38
so you see that MISP has different groups different communities

851
00:26:53,38 --> 00:26:56,640
and it's up to you at the end to decide

852
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,879
which kind of community you want to {inaudiable either be/visit}

854
00:27:01,38 --> 00:27:04,798
So, a little bit besides all the technical things

856
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:06,839
that we talked about, that we do with MISP,

857
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,919
and that we try to solve with it.

858
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,278
In terms of sharing, there are obviously

859
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,720
going to be other hurdles that you have

860
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,159
to overcome whenever it comes to information sharing

862
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,679
one of the the toughest things to

863
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:18,880
1636 --> 1638.88
overcome and this is where no tool can really help you

865
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,679
is to get enough trust in a community to

866
00:27:22,79 --> 00:27:24,319
be able to share your information with them

868
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,918
So the only way to facilitate this is really social interactions

870
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,0
1647.919 --> 1652
so sadly though we're living in times

871
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,278
where social interactions are tougher than usual

873
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,440
but for example events like FIRST conferences

874
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,880
 are great ways to get to know your community and to

876
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,200
build this trust and build those

877
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,159
social relationships that you need 

879
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,679
to be able to really exchange meaningful

880
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,918
information with the community

881
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,0
1667.679 --> 1672
so I really encourage everyone that

882
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,360
wants to partake in information sharing communities

884
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,278
to be social, to reach out, and to get to know your community

886
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,79
because that's the biggest facilitator for sharing in the first place.

888
00:28:00,79 --> 00:28:03,599
Other than that, there are obviously some

889
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,360
legal restrictions that you have

890
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,398
that might come up in the entire process.

891
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,79
We see this very often with organizations where the first

893
00:28:08,79 --> 00:28:10,918
questions that they ask us when they join

895
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,240
in our communities okay how does this

896
00:28:13,38 --> 00:28:18,558
fit into GDPR for example.

897
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,38
If my legal team asks me why I am sharing

898
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,720
an information out what can i

899
00:28:21,38 --> 00:28:24,798
give them as an explanation of why i'm

900
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,159
supposed to or allowed to do this.

901
00:28:25,198 --> 00:28:28,319
So if you need any help with that we

902
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,840
have a bunch of compliance documentation

903
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,240
and that we've been working on together with a bunch of partners

905
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,798
and so we have descriptions for how

906
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,919
MISP fits into the GDPR, the NIS directive

908
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,360
and some other frameworks so just

909
00:28:40,79 --> 00:28:43,119
have a look there and if you have any

910
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,0
1721.36 --> 1724
questions or if you feel that anything is not covered

912
00:28:44,0 --> 00:28:47,599
1724 --> 1727.6
let us know and we keep updating our documentation

914
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,519
based on on feedback of what's missing

915
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,559
or ideas that we should be incorporating in there

917
00:28:52,558 --> 00:29:00,640
but generally , once your legal team is more

919
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,360
familiar with the process and why this

920
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,80
is {inaudible done/tied}

921
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,759
why ensuring security for your

922
00:29:04,79 --> 00:29:06,798
organization and for the data that you

923
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,960
have to secure is important then it's seen more as a

925
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,360
benefit than a hurdle really

926
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,278
but it obviously takes time to get

927
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,240
this into your processes to define why you're

929
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,679
doing what you're doing

930
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,199
your retention periods,

931
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,960
describing how you're going to handle data and so on

933
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,399
so this obviously has some ramp up time

935
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,439
but we have a lot of documentation that will help you with that. 

937
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,558
There are also some practical restrictions that we hear from

938
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,79
organizations so very often when

939
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,440
organizations reach out to us

940
00:29:34,79 --> 00:29:37,199
the first thing they say is we don't

941
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,120
really have any information to share,

942
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,880
we don't have the capability for example

943
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,639
to build those highly vetted threat reports that we're so used to

945
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,960
from feed providers and obviously very few organizations do.

947
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,200
With that said information sharing comes

948
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,600
in many different shapes and sizes for example going back

950
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,558
to the initial use case about

951
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,0
1795.2 --> 1800
providing feedback from your analysts

952
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,240
about the data that you receive from

953
00:30:00,0 --> 00:30:03,839
1800 --> 1803.84
your community is already valuable

954
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,599
information sharing so if someone for

955
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,278
example provides sightings

956
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,839
I've also seen this indicator at this given time

958
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,359
that can already help you tune the data set

960
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,879
for what goes into your working data

961
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,319
sets for detection and blocking and so on.

963
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,960
Also providing information on false

964
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:24,319
positives and some information that

965
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,640
you provided to the community turns out to be false

967
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,960
or something that is no longer relevant

968
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,39
getting information that is valid as

969
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,278
well so pretty much everyone has

970
00:30:33,38 --> 00:30:36,398
information to share by just using the information and running

972
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:44,0
1836.399 --> 1844
into frustration with the data by itself.

973
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,640
Also besides not having information to share

975
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,399
there comes also the issue of time.

976
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:51,759
Most of us are overburdened with

977
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:52,798
the different tasks that we are facing nowadays

979
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,599
so taking extra time out of the day to

981
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,38
encode information and to share it out in the community

983
00:31:01,38 --> 00:31:04,558
is obviously going to be an extra burden

984
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,600
there is no way around it. 

985
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:07,440
What we try to do with MISP

986
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,38
is to make this process as minimal as

987
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,0
1867.44 --> 1870
possible but it is going to be a time investment in the end, after all

989
00:31:10,0 --> 00:31:13,839
1870 --> 1873.84
especially if you want to vet the data if you want to ensure that 

992
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:19,240
the right data reaches the right recipients

994
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:26,240
This always has a time drain on you as well but in return this

996
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,79
is offset by what you gain by sharing that information we're

998
00:31:28,79 --> 00:31:31,359
going to talk about this a little bit

999
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,759
more during the community building part

1000
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,278
about what effects you're going to see

1001
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,640
if you're sharing information and why it is relevant for you

1003
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,120
but to basically sum it up in one sentence

1005
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,239
and whatever affects your organization

1006
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,679
is probably the most important information for you and if you get

1008
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,759
feedback on that, what you're seeing in your network

1010
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:52,398
and more eyes on it, more perspectives

1013
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,159
and perhaps more sophisticated methods of

1014
00:31:56,79 --> 00:31:59,519
research from other organizations

1015
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,600
then that will probably just improve

1016
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,519
your own security posture the best way it can.

1018
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,880
Now, besides timeliness and basically having information to share

1020
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,960
there's also the issue of different

1021
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,240
classification models so classification

1022
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,159
not just in a sense of of deciding who we share information with

1025
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,278
but how we classify information really

1026
00:32:18,79 --> 00:32:22,798
in terms of contextualizating it we are all used

1029
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,159
to naming things a certain way in our organizations in

1030
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,38
our communities and we've probably

1031
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:35,839
been doing it for longer than digital information systems exist 

1034
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,599
so we're probably using a lot of those

1035
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,639
vocabularies that we've been using for decades

1037
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,600
and what one of the things that we

1038
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,678
wanted to avoid with MISP is to

1039
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,639
get these communities to switch to a

1041
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,360
different way of describing things so if you already

1042
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,959
have your set methods, your set processes

1043
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,479
how you define things, we don't want to alter that so one of

1045
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,278
the things that we do with MISP and we are

1046
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,798
going to talk a fair bit about, tomorrow mostly

1048
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:03,679
is that you have ways to describe your

1049
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,0
1981.519 --> 1986
own taxonomies and your own vocabularies

1050
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,120
to use those in your community so very

1051
00:33:06,0 --> 00:33:08,558
1986 --> 1988.559
often when you're spinning up a

1052
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,199
community and when you're starting out

1053
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:10,879
with the sharing community,

1055
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,320
a national sharing community, sectorial one, whatever

1056
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,399
then one of the first tasks is basically

1057
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,720
defining those common vocabularies

1058
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,639
that you're going to be using

1059
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,319
now apart from the vocabularies

1060
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,38
themselves there is also the issue of

1061
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:25,839
of us speaking many different languages

1063
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,519
in terms of of our tools using different formats

1065
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,919
so that means even within our own organization which is

1066
00:33:32,79 --> 00:33:34,639
rather small we have a set of different tools

1068
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,559
that will ingest data in different formats

1070
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,240
or will prefer to ingest data in given

1071
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,119
format so one of the things we also try to do with MISP

1073
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,798
is to act as a hub for all your different tools

1075
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,519
that will get their data translated into

1076
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,960
the format that they can best ingest.

1077
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,839
Obviously this is something where we cannot be completely

1079
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:01,519
100 percent covering all the other

1080
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,879
things that exist out there. 

1081
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,558
So one of the things we try to do with MISP

1082
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,399
is make it as modular as possible and

1083
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:07,278
it's easy to encode your own formats as possible.

1085
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:13,440
We're not going to go deeply into how to do this during the training

1087
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,39
but if anyone is interested about that just

1089
00:34:15,39 --> 00:34:17,599
let us know and we'll point you in the

1090
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:19,598
right direction where you can find

1091
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,159
documentation on how to modularize and

1093
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,159
how to build import and export in MISP.

1094
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,560
So just one side note, all the training

1095
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,320
materials are available online

1096
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,599
like {inaudible} mentioned we have a Github

1097
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,599
repository with a pretty extensive README files with all

1099
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,39
the material that we provide, there is a MISP book too which includes a

1101
00:34:41,39 --> 00:34:45,838
lot of reference to MISP as you know MISP has a 

1103
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,159
pretty large topic coming from technical aspect and

1105
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,480
you will see that in a minute about the project overview.

1107
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,519
So don't hesitate to go there on the MISP training

1109
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,639
page on Github this one is a good

1110
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:02,639
reference because it's really pointing

1111
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:05,920
to the different elements

1112
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,239
that we have. We have a huge slide deck of

1114
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,559
close to 500 pages of slide deck on the

1115
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,679
MISP book we have close to 500 pages. I

1116
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,440
would not mention the number of pages

1117
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:14,719
for taxonomies, galaxies and so on. It's quite large too

1119
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,39
but really look at this as a kind of way

1120
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,239
to shape it to what you like.

1121
00:35:19,39 --> 00:35:23,519
So it's really there to help you and if

1122
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,439
you see something missing

1123
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,800
let us know but we have slides, 

1125
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,200
for example system requirements, things like

1126
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:32,960
for example building community that

1127
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,439
we'll talk tomorrow, that's

1128
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,599
part of it but for more the

1129
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,320
programmatic aspect, API

1130
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,200
how to integrate with MISP {inaudible JSON/taxono},

1131
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,39
how to extend it too

1132
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,799
there are plenty of slides regarding that

1133
00:35:43,39 --> 00:35:46,800
so it's really a good reference

1134
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,560
and thanks to {inaudible} to share this

1135
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,800
information on the chat

1136
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,719
so to just give a quick overview of the MISP project and really to show that

1138
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,399
the project is quite large nowadays

1139
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,838
we basically have like four pillars of things in MISP

1141
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,199
one is obviously the open software itself

1143
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,78
so the initial version in {inaudible} it was

1144
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,239
the small first small block there

1145
00:36:08,79 --> 00:36:11,440
the MISP core software which is like just the software

1147
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,400
mainly for the LMAP aspect where

1148
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,920
you have the backend, the web interface,

1149
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,760
and so on but over the time the project extended

1151
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,40
with multiple things so if you look on the Github

1152
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,800
repository of mid project we have around 50 repositories so

1154
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,720
it's pretty large. Just to summarize what

1155
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,119
are the different one

1156
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,919
we have for example the MISP modules um

1158
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,119
which is an easy way to extend MISP so the behavior of MISP

1160
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,880
on the expansion side on the import, export and so on by just writing

1162
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,480
python modules it's super easy to develop and use

1164
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,920
and the idea behind is obviously to

1165
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:50,960
2206 --> 2210.96
extend MISP without knowing

1166
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,440
the core details about the system 

1167
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,358
then we have a library called PyMISP and this

1168
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,639
PyMISP library is basically a

1169
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:02,319
python library to expose the new MISP platform API

1171
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,39
so MISP has a large REST api this one can be quite large but

1173
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:11,679
by MISP is really helping you to for example {inaudible jest/Get} events

1174
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,200
create feeds and stuff like that so it's

1175
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,358
really important if you want to

1176
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,39
extend MISP to have a look at PyMISP that

1177
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,480
is not the only library for extending

1179
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,440
MISP some in golang you have some

1180
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,639
other in python too, you have others in java and so on

1182
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,0
2244.64 --> 2248
but the PyMISP one is the one that

1183
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,199
is maintained by the author of MISP so it is maintained by us

1186
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,399
and you can have a look at this one it's

1187
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,0
2252.48 --> 2256
really the one that's up to date it's

1188
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,0
2254.4 --> 2258
really core and part of the system too

1189
00:37:36,0 --> 00:37:40,400
2256 --> 2260.4
because we use it for our own tests

1190
00:37:38,0 --> 00:37:42,320
2258 --> 2262.32
within MISP then we have different

1191
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,358
repository I will just mention one which is

1193
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:46,559
dashboard, the dashboard is an extension module

1195
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,838
in MISP using what we call the ZeroMQ feed in MISP

1196
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,159
so we have a kind of way to have kind of a real-time feed

1198
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,799
in MISP you can {inaudible} and

1199
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,639
so on but we wanted to show an example

1200
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,240
application for that and the MISP

1201
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,879
dashboard is exactly that

1202
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,559
is a way to really get all the

1203
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,960
information that you have in MISP

1204
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,920
into a very nice dashboard and so on

1205
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,760
this is really to have a good example of what you can do

1207
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,240
with information within MISP and how you can use it

1209
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:17,519
so that's the main pillar you have

1210
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:18,79
plenty of other projects but those one are the main ones

1212
00:38:18,79 --> 00:38:22,400
on top of that you have

1213
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,358
what we call the intelligent and knowledge database of

1215
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,119
MISP and just mentioned about the difficulty

1217
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,280
sometimes in some organizations to use a

1218
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,519
{inaudible proper/corporate} classification and so on

1219
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,40
and we try to ease this in this

1220
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,639
different organization by having a kind

1221
00:38:35,39 --> 00:38:37,279
of library of all the taxonomies that exist

1223
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,519
so we started as a very simple one where

1224
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,358
it was just including for example a

1225
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,440
taxonomy like the traffic light protocol one, FIRST is using it

1227
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,119
and it's a commonly used classification but over

1228
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:50,320
the time we have seen that many

1229
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,720
organizations have different

1230
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,320
classification and so on. So we already

1231
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:55,838
in advance we prepare all those taxonomies in

1233
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,599
possible information {inaudible} expose MISP

1234
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,399
and you can enable the one that you want

1235
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,39
so we have around 150 libraries now

1236
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,680
ranging from classifications, specific one for

1238
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:10,559
intelligence communities and some

1239
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,399
other activities so this one is our

1240
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,440
really useful label and you can just

1241
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,39
{inaudible share/pick} the one that you want and we maintain those one

1243
00:39:15,39 --> 00:39:18,880
so we have some that are coming from

1244
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,39
third party, some that we are collecting

1245
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,39
as each projects are creating.

1246
00:39:21,39 --> 00:39:24,719
It's really usually a good source to see

1247
00:39:23,39 --> 00:39:26,838
how other communities are using

1248
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,639
classifying and contextualizing the

1249
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:30,480
information, there nevertheless the

1250
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:35,759
taxonomy itself was like kind of labels, those labels were quite small

1253
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,960
so it was not like completely extensive information so

1255
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,39
over the time we maintain a kind of more extensive one called the galaxy

1257
00:39:41,39 --> 00:39:47,279
you will hear the term very often

1258
00:39:44,79 --> 00:39:49,200
those galaxies are defining many things

1259
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,40
for example one of the most common one is the threat actor

1261
00:39:50,39 --> 00:39:54,400
we have a huge database of threat actors but a lot of

1262
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,400
times it was extended

1263
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,320
for example, Microsoft is not using

1264
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,358
threat actors for example there is this activity group is part of the

1266
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:05,119
galaxy, it's really one that we

1267
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,760
use for different and you can represent whatever

1269
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,280
galaxy you want so you have a predefined

1270
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:10,960
set of existing one but you can create your own 

1272
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,400
so if you have your own threat actor database

1273
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,480
you can create your own from scratch or

1274
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,280
you can reuse and fork existing ones so

1275
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,480
that's really those kind of things that we manage in

1277
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,920
the project is not only code and software

1278
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,39
we manage those kind of knowledge base

1280
00:40:23,39 --> 00:40:27,759
for intelligent {inaudible} organization

1281
00:40:26,79 --> 00:40:29,200
we have some specific one like the notice list

1283
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:32,480
this one is a pretty small one that you use for the GDPR aspect

1285
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,480
but this one can be used for anything you want,

1287
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,960
It's for informing the analyst or the user of MISP when he

1288
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:41,440
touched some specific information in MISP

1290
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,280
that could impact for example the legal framework and so on

1292
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,280
it's actively use in the intelligence community,

1293
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,960
law enforcement and so on maybe less in

1294
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,880
security operation center but it's

1295
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,880
coming more and more due to the legal

1296
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,240
side of information sharing and

1297
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,480
especially storing information that might contain personal information

1299
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,480
then we have another one called the

1300
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:08,159
warning list and Andras quickly mentioned this kind of recurring problems or false positives

1303
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:12,719
and the one in MISP are basically list of existing potential false positives

1305
1306
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,439
for example we have lists of well-known IP addresses from Microsoft, for example.

1308
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,800
We have list of things like domain names used by Google and so on

1310
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,599
that's already helping users to find out

1311
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,119
if something might be a false positive

1312
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,559
and we do that automatically and we

1313
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,800
maintain those libraries because one {inaudible MISP/reason} they're automatically updated regularly

1315
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,79
I think we have around 50 lists nowadays

1318
00:41:34,79 --> 00:41:38,160
It's really useful when you do on a day-to-day basis and creating events and

1320
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,838
so on you can really find and spot things that might be a false positive in advance

1323
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:48,0
2503.119 --> 2508
by having those warning lists enabled

1324
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,839
and again it's up to the user to select

1325
00:41:48,0 --> 00:41:53,39
2508 --> 2511.04
one {inaudible} warning list or to enable everything depending on the different use case

1328
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,920
so that's one of those {inaudible} pillar

1329
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,519
knowledge base I mean a lot of

1330
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,519
contributions coming from threat parties

1332
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,480
are coming from that aspect so it's not really programmers

1333
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,679
or coders that are contributing there

1334
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,599
but it's more analysts and people doing really threat intelligence

1336
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,160
or classification and so on 

1337
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,79
is really something that is useful for everyone

1338
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,159
without being your direct contributions on the code

1340
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,719
then over the times we we we became a kind of de facto standard and

1342
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,480
uh nowadays is even more than a de facto standard, is a standard

1344
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,199
We published as an interesting engineering task force draft

1346
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,439
all those documents especially the core format

1348
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,200
and to ease that for the development of external tools
1350
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,279
integration and so on. 

1351
00:42:38,0 --> 00:42:40,119
2558 --> 2561.119
So if you're interested you can go to the

1352
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,319
MISP platform website where we describe the different standards that we

1354
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,199
published. We even co-host standards that are for people

1356
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,598
integrating with MISP

1357
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,599
and we have specific standards for example for the object template

1359
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,800
and that's something that we will talkabout but that's something that was

1360
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,79

1361
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,839
really a need for us from the early beginning of MISP

1363
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:02,799
a lot of organizations want to have their own structure of information

1365
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,880
about objects and so on and we have a flexible model in MISP to

1367
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,358
really create your own data models and this one is standardized too

1369
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,358
and it's really helping sharing communities to

1371
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,318
extend MISP as they wish and their models without breaking the

1373
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,79
the standards itself so that's really interesting for for showing you new models

1376
00:43:24,79 --> 00:43:28,79
and then next to that we will do everything possible to help community

1378
00:43:28,79 --> 00:43:31,359
and Andras just mentioned the question of the

1380
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,679
legal aspect and I think maybe some of

1381
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,640
you already have this order to

1382
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,399
seek legal team about the information sharing policies and so on

1384
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,880
we try to make it easier so we publish this kind of compliance document

1386
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,160
and so on it's part of the MISP project

1387
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:50,879
everything is open source again so everything we do is open source and

1389
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,760
on open access. You can reuse it and so on. We have for example a specific

1391
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,679
document about building communities which is something that we do within the X-ISAC project

1394
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:08,960
and it's containing kind of best practices what are kind of agreement that you can

1397
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,119
use when doing a setup of sharing communities.

1399
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,440
Up to things about how to do contextualization and so on

1400
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,40
so that's that's maybe something that

1401
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,519
for an organization that wants to boost up an ISAC or sharing communities they can

1404
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,760
look at those documents and so on so it's again a thing that we try to help

1406
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,800
for example we produce kind of OSINT feeds of existing reports and so on to

1408
00:44:30,800 -->  00:44:36,880
not only have software ready but to have some content and to show what kind of

1411
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,559
information can be shared within different MISP communities.

1413
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,880
So let us some get some of the naming conventions out of the way

1415
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,880
before we start with the hands-on stuff and

1416
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:58,719
just a quick explanation of the different uh data points and uh and naming conventions

1419
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,400
that we use for them so it's a bit easier afterwards

1421
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:08,0
this can be a bit overwhelming, don't worry we'll go through everything step by step also

1424
00:45:04,639 --> 
during the hands-on part 

1426
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:13,440
So basically all the data that goes into MISP, we separate into two main layers

1427
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:14,880
one we call data layer which is really everything it has to do with

1429
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:22,0
individual data points their compositioning and so on

1432
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,358
So everything that we share in MISP in general in this regard

1433
00:45:22,0 --> 00:45:25,199
2722 --> 2725.2
starts with something that we call an event, these are our general

1435
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:28,559
envelopes for information so that means that

1437
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,960
whenever we're describing an incident, we're describing a threat report 

1439
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,0
2732.96 --> 2736
we're describing a watch list that we recurringly update

1441
00:45:36,0 --> 00:45:40,400
2736 --> 2740.4
and they will all be grouped into something that we call an event

1443
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,680
So the name is a little bit controversial at times, we try to pick a name

1445
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,519
that is the least amount of a loaded term that we could find

1448
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,240
but obviously even with that there it can be a bit confusing but just consider

1450
00:45:56,239 --> 
it as a generic container for data that has some contextual linking
 
1453
00:45:59,39 --> 00:46:06,318
then each of these events is populated with lists of attributes. 

1455
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:09,838
So attributes are the most basic data points in MISP

1457
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,279
an attribute can describe for example an IP address

1459
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:21,199
you can describe a file hash or it can describe a car plate number for example

1462
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:27,759
It's basically just an individual data point with some basic context around it

1465
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,800
such as describing in what context this was seen in

1467
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,960
what type we're using to describe the attribute, 

1469
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,679
for example that we're using an MD5 hash to describe the hash of a file

1471
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:44,318
would be one of those descriptions, hopefully not used as much these days

1473
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:51,920
but that's just an example and then we can take these individual attributes

1476
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,318
and composite them into what we call objects that are describing multifaceted concepts.

1478
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:59,440
For example, a file object would be described by a list of attributes

1480
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:05,760
including a file name, different file hashes, maybe file entropy and so on and so forth.

1484
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,440
Each of these individual objects and attributes can then be further interlinked by what we call references.

1487
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,119
So that means that most of the time when we're describing data in MISP 

1489
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,0
we're trying to tell a story so we're thinking graphs instead of individual data points

1492
00:47:20,0 --> 00:47:24,559
2840 --> 2844.559
that means that we can for example, describe the entire flow of an attack

1494
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,79
from the initial attack vector all the way to the exploitation

1496
00:47:28,79 --> 00:47:33,599
using the interconnected graphs using these references so we could say

1498
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,960
initially it all started with an email that was received

1500
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,559
that contained for example a malicious sample which then had to send this effect

1503
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,838
in our infrastructure so all of these different steps can be then described

1506
00:47:45,0 --> 00:47:53,519
2868 --> 2873.52
via different references there then to aggregate this information

1508
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,79
into and aggregate the sightings of this information via structure

1510
00:47:58,79 --> 00:48:02,280
that basically captures sightings from our different information sources 

1512
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,760
that means if you have an IDS that is generating alerts

1514
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,640
you can feed information back on when individual attributes were seen

1516
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:16,159
in your network, in your premises or at your partners and so on

1518
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,920
so this is basically it for the data layer, these are our main building blocks for that.

1521
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,599
now in order to contextualize this information, we have different tools at our disposal.

1523
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,160
The most simple one is what we call tags these are basic text labels that 

1525
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:35,598
we attach on individual data points or entire events

1527
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,440
and these can either be created freely or most commonly they come from what we call taxonomies.

1530
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,400
They're basically standardized vocabularies and that are either shared

1532
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:54,880
by us so the MISP project at large or by individual communities to their members so

1535
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,39
these vocabularies can include anything from for example something is simple and

1537
00:48:57,39 --> 00:49:01,279
and commonly used as TLP to national classifications 

1540
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:08,719
to various different sectoral classifications and so on

1541
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:12,79
now if you wanted to provide more high-level information instead of just simple

1544
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,640
labels for the information we can use what we call galaxy clusters

1546
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,400
so galaxy cluster is basically a knowledge based element that we use as a label

1549
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,879
these can be either coming from standard libraries 

1551
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,480
such as the ones that we maintain or you can create them ad-hoc in MISP.

1553
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,0
That means if you're describing a threat actor 

1555
00:49:30,0 --> 00:49:35,358
you could create create a threat actor galaxy cluster that describes the various metadata

1557
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:38,558
about the threat actor and then use this to label your data whenever you think

1560
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,160
that whatever you're describing is associated with a threat actor

1562
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:46,480
you can also create for example a galaxy cluster describing the different

1564
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:53,760
target sectors and then interlink using cluster relationships

1566
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:04,559
the threat actor galaxy clusters with target sectors with exploited TTP and so on and so forth

1569
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,39
So these are the high level structures that you can put on top of your data 

1572
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:14,838
basically to further contextualize it. Alex

1574
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:21,39
Yeah, so just to summarize it and that's always a lot of people are asking about it

1577
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:26,319
how do you summarize it about, for example in easy way you have to see really

1580
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,838
MISP {inaudible environment/development} as an envelope and then you

1581
00:50:28,79 --> 00:50:32,318
have information inside and then what Andras describe is basically

1583
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:34,800
different component that you have within that envelope and then you have

1586
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:42,480
contextual layers on that envelope and relationship that are basically based on on that.

1589
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:50,400
So, another thing that is very often and I think it is good to explain it, is about the

1592
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,119
terminology between indicators, attributes, and so on that is

1594
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,358
a different especially indicator of compromise and so on

1596
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,440
In MISP, an attribute is close to an indicator

1598
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,599
and we have this kind of flexible models where

1600
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,200
maybe some of you are familiar with observables in MISP

1602
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,440
we call it attributes and those observables are basically depending on the type

1605
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,0
So, we have a specific flag in attributes which is basically defining

1608
00:51:20,0 --> 00:51:23,599
3080 --> 3083.599
if information can be used automatically for detection

1610
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:29,960
and that's I think one of the most important aspects when we talk about attribute in MISP

1613
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,119
an attribute can become an observable or become an indicator of compromise

1615
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,880
depending on the simple flag and this is quite important because

1618
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:43,599
a lot of analysis and so on will depend on that and especially all you will use that afterwards

1621
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,39
if you plan for example to use the data into a protective systems and so on 
 
1624
00:51:48,39 --> 00:51:54,79
the IDS flags need to be set so the thing is if I take an example 

1626
00:51:54,79 --> 00:51:56,480
you reverse the malware and this malware is connected to google.com for testing the connectivity

1629
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:04,79
obviously you will have an attribute for example www.google.com

1632
00:52:03,79 --> 00:52:09,440
and this one is an interesting indicator for information for the analyst

1634
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,0
so like that you can for example maybe cluster those kind of malware together as in this kind of behavior

1637
00:52:14,0 --> 00:52:19,279
3134 --> 3136.64
nevertheless you are not really interested in that information as an indicator of compromise

1641
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,480
because it will generate a huge amount of false positive 

1644
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,640
but if for example at some point you have an IP address that is really dedicated to that malware 

1646
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:39,719
then you will set the IDS flag, so the thing is when you define in MISP these flags

1649
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,599
and we will show you later on it's very important because it will define what you can do 

1652
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:48,639
3164 --> 3166.64
with information later on if you're going to automate and so on like

1655
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,239
In MISP, what we try to do too instead of having just indicators

1657
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:57,280
it's very common and I think many of you know about it you might see for example 

1660
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,599
a list of hashes so like for example MD5 hashes without any context

1662
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,280
and sometimes it's difficult to know exactly what we are talking about

1664
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,599
Are we talking about MD5 of malicious sample, are we talking about md5 of legitimate software,

1667
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:17,39
are we talking about the MD5 value of the X.509 certificate, 

1669
00:53:17,39 --> 00:53:29,719
are we talking about an MD5 as a mutex in memory 

1670
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:25,759
we have plenty of way of seeing those kind of MD5 so we try in MISP to have what we call the

1673
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:30,318
kind of I would not say {inaudible keep shine/kill shine} but at least contextualization a category that

1675
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:35,279
help to see in which context this has been seen

1677
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:41,119
and as for example if 1 MD5 might have a payload delivery, telling that in which scope this has been set

1680
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,440
So that means in MISP we have always and complementary type

1682
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:52,639
so for example for an MD5 files you can say that this one is from a file or is an md5 of a fingerprint thing

1686
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:59,679
So that means, always in MISP try to have as an indicator all those three information together 

1689
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:06,639
so it is giving at least more context and if you cannot set this context MISP will try to automatically set it.

1692
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:12,239
So attributes are equal to indicators but with a bit more of information which is useful for you

1695
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:19,358
At least being in a way to understand what is in a position to understand what you have in front of you

1699
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:28,400
when you have to treat those attributes.

1700
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:29,920
So this is just a brief view of what this looks like. 

1702
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:36,239
We're going to see this more in practice basically the idea is that all the data that we have in  MISP

1705
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:43,798
if it's well defined allows us to draw a graph out of the data and allows us to tell a story more easily

1708
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:55,798
So here we see a simple example that basically shows the bank account that is associated with the threat actor

1712
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,679
With all the various different data points with it and then we can basically relate these

1715
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,200
different data points to each other and give the relationship a term as well 

1718
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,160
So in this case we see from the chart immediately there that that person is the owner of that

1720
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:13,119
bank account with all those different data points for us as humans it's it's generally much more

1724
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,839
easily understood if we look at a graph like that and tell the story that way 

1727
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:22,480
then if we look at a tabularized view of the data.

1728
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:24,239
So one of the goals and something that we hope that we get out of 
 
1731
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:32,480
going through trainings like these is to really convert also the participants

1732
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:38,558
to to see the value of producing data in that way instead of just sharing raw indicator lists for example.

1735
00:55:40,0 --> 00:55:45,199
3340 --> 3343.2
And that's again what we think that's really important is the contextualization again.

1738
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,480
So I mentioned we have the galaxies in MISP and we have plenty of representation

1741
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:55,838
threat actors and so on and obviously one that is quite important is the MITRE Attack one

1744
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,759
so MITRE Attack is {inaudible stored/performed} as a galaxy

1746
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,520
and we have this flexible {inaudible mosaic/table} in MISP that you can represent those kind of

748
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:07,39
matrix-like model which is a case for Attack which is a very convenient way of representing the 

1752
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:14,480
different techniques in a progressive way used by the attackers and that's exactly what we can do in MISP. 

1755
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:22,79
So you have this kind of model and we have different model formats so again we have an advanced

1758
00:56:22,79 --> 00:56:30,838
i would say integration with Attack but you can extend it with multiple different kinds of galaxies which are

1762
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:33,838
3390 --> 3393.839
similar to Attack or complementary for example we have the Industrial Control System of Attack,

1765
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,440
it's a separated galaxy, you can even create a custom one directly in the system 

1768
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,519
and then you can filter out your data and so on and that's exactly the thing why we are I would say

1771
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,480 
in bracket pushing people to do more contextualization, it would be useful forthem at the end

1774
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:58,960
because this kind of information is really showing you for example your gap in your defense

1778
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,720
your specific things that the techniques that are not used by an attacker 

1780
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,279
you might ask why, maybe because you are missing a specific detection point that you cannot

1783
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:12,239
detect this kind of attacks or things like that so it's really actively using the data

1786
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:15,759
to show something meaningful with it and I think Attack is one of the way

1788
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,119 
but if you can combine this with additional information like site links, 

1789
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,239
contextualization of the relationship between different objects and so on

1792
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,558
basically everything in hand to improve your posture and secure it.

1794
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,0
Yeah perhaps something to add to this as well,

1796
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:33,838
some of the additional advantages is the moment that you encode all this information along

1798
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:39,39
with the data you can start asking those those questions from your tool basically

1800
00:57:39,39 --> 00:57:47,838
for example show me what sort of threats my constituency is facing over the past year

1804
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,760
and overlayed over how what sort of threats it was facing a year ago 

1806
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,319
what are the trends that have evolved since then

1808
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:58,960
the other thing that it really helps with is it also gives you a high level overview of individual reports

1811
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:06,78
that means if I'm looking at an event in MISP and it has 800 different attributes described in there

1815
00:58:06,79 --> 00:58:10,719
making any sense out of that quickly is very difficult, but getting a high level overview using MITRE Attack

1818
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:16,239
where you say oh okay this has to deal with spearphishing, it has to deal with information exfiltration,

1821
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:22,79
so these immediately tell me the story of what i'm dealing with without having to dig deeper into the data itself

1825
00:58:22,79 --> 00:58:27,480
so it is incredibly useful for an analyst that is trying to make sense of the data that you're sharing.

1828
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:36,0
Also, as for the sharing itself I mean one of the main goals with MISP is obviously to share information,

1831
00:58:36,0 --> 00:58:43,280
We haven't really talked about the sharing mechanisms yet, we basically have a bunch of different functionalities in MISP

1834
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,639
that we're going to see over the next two days the deal with distributing the information.

1838
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:55,280
One of the most obvious ones to tackle is basically who is to be the recipient of information that we're sharing

1842
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:04,400
so basically MISP, we can basically set the distribution settings for each individual data point individually

1846
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,760
or for entire collections of data in one shot so that means if we create an event we can decide who we share the event with 

1849
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,160
but we can further restrict individual attributes or objects further. 

1854
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:26,79
Now, who we share the information with gets decided on using one of two different means,

1857
00:59:25,79 --> 00:59:29,39
one of them is a simple system where we tell MISP you are allowed to distribute it to everyone 

1858
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,280
that has access to this community, for example.

1860
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:39,440
Or to everyone that is directly connected to my community but you can also define more strict distribution lists

1863
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:44,400
what we call sharing groups where you individually name the organizations that are to be the recipients.

1868
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:52,159
Now on top of that, one of the things that we often struggle with is especially if you're in some of those communities

1872
00:59:51,159 --> 01:00:01,39
or you're taking part or assisting some of the communities where sharing any information might lead to reputation or financial loss.

1876
01:00:01,39 --> 01:00:04,318
For example in the financial sector we have these worries very often

1878
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:08,318
where if a financial organization were to share any information out

1880
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:11,838
it could be misconstrued as a successful attack against them.

1882
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:15,719
So instead, they choose to basically even if it was something completely benign

1884
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,239
that they caught in their sandboxes, in their honeypots, whatever

1887
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:24,399
and they decide not to share it out of fear of incurring this reputation loss.

1889
01:00:24,399 --> 01:00:29,440
So one of the things that we have in MISP is this system called Delegation 

1891
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,920
where you can, for example appoint your ISAC,
 
1892
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:38,558
your central authority for a community, a national CSIRT, whatever 

1893
01:00:38,558 --> 01:00:41,599
with the responsibility of taking over the data that you produce

1898
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,480
and to share it out in their name  

1900
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:48,838
so that way, it's basically a semi anonymized information sharing 

1901
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,880
where you are completely removed from the data that is shared out

1903
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,500
so the only two parties that will know who the originator of the data is you

1904
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:01,500
and whoever is taking over the data and taking over responsibility for the data.

1909
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:05,280
On top of that, one of the things that we wanted to achieve with MISP 

1911
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,720
was basically to build a collaboration with our different partners

1913
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:11,519
so it means that whenever we're sharing information we don't want it to

1915
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:14,358
be a one-way communication, so we don't want to have 

1916
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:17,500
this whole feed, provider and consumers relationship 

1919
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,798
but we want everyone to be able to chip in with their ideas

1920
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,559
so while anything that you produce in MISP will only be tied and editable

1921
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,719
by your organization, others can make proposals or counter analysis to it.

1924
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,919
So proposals are a system where you can basically flag information

1926
01:01:32,919 --> 01:01:37,0
as incorrect and provide feedback on how to improve it 

1928
01:01:37,0 --> 01:01:40,0
or how you can add your own perspective to an event,

1930
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:42,0
so if you receive an event from a third party you can say 

1931
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:44,400
oh I can improve it and {inaudible listen/discern} this way

1932
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,8
please incorporate these changes in the event

1933
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:49,500
and then the original producer can make the decision 

1935
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,519
whether to incorporate it or discard your changes.

1936
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,358
As for counter analysis, this is what we call extend events.

1938
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:59,358
You can basically create an event that latches onto an original 

1940
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,38
shared by a third party and provide your own perspective of it.

1942
01:02:03,0 --> 01:02:06,160
and then you keep full control of the data and you become the owner

1945
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,440
of whatever the extension is that you produce to the original event.

1946
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:17,280
This happens very often for us, for example when a vendor shares out a report.

1949
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,0
For example, we get a report from say kaspersky and we have additional information 

1951
01:02:20,0 --> 01:02:25,519
or we have a different opinion on something, 

1954
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:29,960
then we might create an extended event that we share out to our constituency 

1957
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,358
which if they have access to the original report will latch onto it

1958
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:37,0
and it will show our perspective on top of the original.

1960
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:41,440
Now as for the exchange itself, every organization is free to host their own

1962
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,960
MISP instance and then they can decide who they want to interconnect with

1964
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,240
if both parties agree, a synchronization link is established

1966
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:51,838
between the two MISP instance and sharing can start flowing between them.

1968
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:55,0
Now this sharing is still governed by those distribution lists 

1970
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,199
and by some other mechanism that we'll talk about more tomorrow 

1972
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:04,0
but basically MISP exchanges information between the individual nodes

1974
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,880
in kind of a mesh network way.

1976
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,0
We also have feed system that allows us to generate feeds

1977
01:03:10,0 --> 01:03:11,960
and to share those feeds with larger communities.

1979
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,559
So we as CIRCL we provide another SIEM feed, for example

1980
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,0
that we make freely available in our infrastructure

1981
01:03:20,0 --> 01:03:22,440
anyone can just point their MISP to it and adjust the data

1983
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,119
and keep it updated using the feed system, this is also great

1985
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:30,0
if you have ever have the need of sharing information between air gap systems.

1986
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:37,0
You can just generate a feed based on certain filter rules and basically

1989
01:03:37,0 --> 01:03:43,0
share it through say a flash drive or something like that, with an internal system

1993
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:48,720
Now all of these filtering options are basically user defined

1994
01:03:48,0 --> 01:03:50,880
and they rely heavily also on the contextualization  

1997
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,0
so very often what we're doing and especially

1998
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:57,0
if you were ever signing up for the COVID instance that I mentioned before

2000
01:03:57,0 --> 01:04:00,559
is you can also make those decisions based on the context, 

2002
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,960
what data you're interested in, what date you're interested in sharing out.

2004
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,400
For example, if you connect to COVID instance, we categorize all of the

2006
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,79
information into three categories, health related information

2008
01:04:9,79 --> 01:04:12,720
so basically information about the spread of the pandemic,

2010
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:16,399
information about misinformation targeting COVID,

2012
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:22,0
and also cyber security threats that are targeting, that are now basically 

2014
01:04:21,0 --> 01:04:27,0
abusing the whole COVID situation with remote work and so on.

2016
01:04:27,0 --> 01:04:30,0
so if you're only interested in one or two of these three different topics,

2019
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:36,0
then you can set up your filters to only ingest data coming from a subset of the data set

2021
01:04:36,0 --> 01:04:39,0
Very often what we do as well is we have these internal MISP clusters

2023
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:44,0 
in our own organization as well, where we collect information from different sources

2026
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:48,798
so we have a dedicated MISP instance where we purely collect spam information for example

2029
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:52,0
So for a constituency, anyone can forward their spam to us

2031
01:04:52,0 --> 01:04:55,358
and we'll just generate events out of those in that MISP. 

2032
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:56,38
Generally this information 

2033
01:04:56,38 --> 01:05:00,480
is really not interesting for a day-to-day detection use, for example.

2036
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,679
But what we do is we cache this information and we can cross-correlate

2038
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:05,759
this information with our operational instance

2040
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,839
that means if we start the analysis process and we start an investigation

2042
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:14,239
then we immediately see the moment we start encoding data points

2044
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,598
oh this is something that was already flagged once in our spam instance

2046
01:05:18,598 --> 01:05:210,359
this information that that instance knows about, 

2048
01:05:210,359 --> 01:05:24,840
then we can pivot over to that instance and fetch the information

2049
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,400
related to that same data point that we're also seeing in our current incident

2052
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,0
and perhaps get more information that is relevant for us from there.

2054
01:05:32,0 --> 01:05:35,79
3932 --> 3936.079
So basically very often we have these multi MISP internal enclaves

2057
01:05:35,79 --> 01:05:42,0
that help us basically to separate different concerns and

2058
01:05:41,0 --> 01:05:44,0
different collection mechanisms into their own instances.

2060
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,39
Just in that scope and I think is linked to the question that we had

2062
01:05:49,39 --> 01:05:52,799
regarding the multi MISP internal enclave

2064
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:57,599
someone was asking about synchronizing with an existing MISP and so.

2066
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,720
You have this kind of local enclave options, where you can synchronize to MISP

2068
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:05,199
like they behave in the same organization, that's one of the interesting options.

2071
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,358
By the way, I would just give the mic to Josh that will explain a bit more about 

2074
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:16,0
the question and answer in zoom, to have directly the ability to answer the question answering the Zoom {inaudible}

2077
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,639
I just want to jump in real quick, yeah if you have any questions 

2080
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:26,400
please direct them at the Q&A board versus the chat room 

2081
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,0
that way we can kind of keep a monitor of that 

2082
01:06:28,0 --> 01:06:32,0
and other people can actually see the questions and the answer directly in that area

2085
01:06:32,0 --> 01:06:38,0
so if you have questions feel free to use the Q&A board and that's all 

2086
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:43,199
thank you josh that's very useful so we can keep track of them and we can answer live or

2090
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,700
directly in the chat. 

2091
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:49,520
Okay great, so you see that the sharing aspect of MISP is like pretty extensive

2094
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,279
and you have different models of of usage of MISP 

2097
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:58,318
some people have this pre-conception about MISP being like oh I need to share with MISP 

2099
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:01,119
no, it's depending on what you want to do with your MISP instance

2101
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,500
and the core functionality of MISP is really to give, I would say the freedom 

2104
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:11,0
to each of the organizations to decide what to do with the data, if they want to share or not

2106
01:07:11,0 --> 01:07:17,359
and we always design MISP that everyone can be kind of consumers
 
2109
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,838
so that basically getting data from different fields or producer or contributors

2110
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:29,0
Andras mentioned a different way of contributing like sightings, making proposals, things like that

2114
01:07:29,0 --> 01:07:34,240
but it's up to the original contributors to decide if they want to share 

2117
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:41,119
that's really the thing, with MISP you can set up a MISP for like just pulling data, getting the data and that's it

2120
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:46,480
and if at one point in time you want to like push some data you can just enable it and that's it 

2123
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,0
so it's really, it's just a matter of just tuning the configuration ,

2126
01:07:51,0 --> 01:07:53,0
the filtering really on the synchronization, if you want to share.

2128
01:07:53,0 --> 01:07:55,838
So you don't have to change anything in your MISP instance

2129
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,0
it's just a matter of of what you decide and what you need to share

2132
01:07:59,0 --> 01:08:01,500
and then the thing that is really important in MISP

2133
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,760
everything can be in flex. I mean even for example that we were mentioning 

2135
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,240
so those kind of envelope information might change over time

2137
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:15,0
we have seen for example some past or incident report that has been updated like 

2140
01:08:15,0 --> 01:08:19,0
two years later because they discover who was the target or the threat actor behind

2142
01:08:19,0 --> 01:08:24,0
and that's the thing that's really in MISP that we really want to be flexible 

2145
01:08:24,0 --> 01:08:29,500
you can really expand the information either internally, add some comment and so on

2147
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:35,359
and to share this information in your different MISP instances and share with partners,

2150
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,200
your teams and so on so. 

2151
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:42,0
Really, MISP the core functionality of MISP is distributing information 

2153
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:46,500
but if you don't want to use it it's fine you just don't enable synchronization 

2156
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,0
but if you want to use partially, part of synchronization and so on 

2158
01:08:50,0 --> 01:08:53,838
you just set up this kind of parameters. 

2160
01:08:55,0 --> 01:09:00,0
So on top of collecting all this information

2161
01:09:00,0 --> 01:09:03,0
and synchronizing the information that we talked about before

2162
01:09:03,0 --> 01:09:06,0
we basically do a bunch of different stuff to improve 

2164
01:09:06,0 --> 01:09:08,0
to handle the quality management of the information as well.

2165
01:09:08,0 --> 01:09:11,0
So one of the first things we do, this is something we mentioned a bit before

2167
01:09:11,0 --> 01:09:16,0
is we correlate information so we're interested in data that we've already seen before

2170
01:09:16,0 --> 01:09:18,559
we also have the feedback loop that we mentioned before with sightings 

2172
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,0
that means we really want to get timeliness to the information as well

2175
01:09:22,0 --> 01:09:27,439
so that we can but make better decisions on what we keep in our working data set for detection,

2177
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,5
for blocking and so on.

2178
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,679
The false positive management is a huge part so the warning list system

2180
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:37,0
where we basically exclude those typical false positives

2182
01:09:37,0 --> 01:09:41,440
plays a very important role in the legal equation and this is also a community driven effort

2184
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:46,0
so if you want to get involved with that and build and include your own infrastructure 

2187
01:09:46,0 --> 01:09:48,399
for example in the warning list and so on,

2189
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:53,0
either do it internally for your MISP or just share it with the open source community as well

2191
01:09:53,0 --> 01:09:56,719
so let us know if you want to have that included as well 

2193
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,500
we haven't talked about enrichment systems yet 

2195
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,880
but basically one of the things that we do in MISP is 

2196
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,238 
we have connectors to all those different services that you might already be subscribed to

2199
01:10:05,238  --> 01:10:11,439
so if you have domain tools, passive total or what way or any of the other services

2202
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:15,439
intel 471, and so on that you already subscribed to, then you can use  

2205
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:19,600
those services to enrich the data that you're working on 

2208
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,0
so if you have an incident and you're encoding information 

2209
01:10:22,0 --> 01:10:24,640
you go out to all the services that you connect, that you have access to

2210
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,600
4224.64 --> 4228
and fetch the information on what else those systems know about the different data points that you're encoding

2213
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,679
so that you basically get a jump start on your investigation.

2215
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:37,119
Now one of the most important things that we have to deal with and this is probably 

2217
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:42,559
i think about 50% of the code base of MISP 

2219
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,560
is basically the APIs and the libraries that deal with integrating MISP with other tools

2221
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,580
so everything that we can do by the UI, MISP is also exposed to the api

2223
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:54,960
and one of the most important things for us is to make sure that

2225
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:00,0
you can use MISP as simply a backend for another tool as opposed to just directly using MISP itself.

2228
01:11:00,0 --> 01:11:04,640
As for timeliness, we haven't really touched on that yet.

2230
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,480
Besides the sighting aspect, you can also encode information about time ranges when something was seen

2233
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:19,200
and you can build a full timeline of the events that occurred during a cyber incident for example.

2237
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,719
So if you encode this information together with all your data points

2239
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,960
then you get an additional graph out of it that tells you when what happens

2241
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,0
and time-based correlations are really important as well.

2243
01:11:30,0 --> 01:11:33,599
So very often when you're seeing two things happening at the same time

2245
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,800
they might be related with each other and 

2248
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:40,960
they might be worth digging into whether there is a link between those two things that happened.

2250
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,480
So something else that we will touch on more tomorrow 

2251
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,200
is we have a full indicator lifecycle management system in MISP.

2254
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,0
That means you can define your own rules and tune your own rules 

2256
01:11:50,0 --> 01:11:53,500
on how you're going to be scoring and decaying indicators 

2257
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:57,119
based on all the contextualization that you have,

2258
01:11:57,119 --> 01:11:58,719
based on the type of the data that you have, 

2259
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,439
based on source of the information that you have and so on and so forth.

2260
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:09,0
So we're going to go into much more detail on that tomorrow. Alex.

2265
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:20,359
Yeah, so I was just answering a question and then I will make it public in a minute

2267
01:12:20,359 --> 01:12:25,639
that's a question about the API and using MISP. 

2270
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:30,0
There are different ways to evaluate the quality of the information that you share in MISP.

2273
01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:35,238
One of those is obviously to look at statistics, There is a statistics version in MISP to see 

2276
01:12:35,238 --> 01:12:40,238
for example, the kind of indicator shared by organization and so on.

2278
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:43,279
In addition to that, there is for example 

2279
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:46,279
MISP dashboard which includes a kind of gamification of the platforms

2281
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:53,600
and which is giving badges per organization depending on the kind of information that you share

2284
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:59,520
and that's a nice way to to find out if you are reaching a certain level of capabilities when using MISP

2287
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,360
where you basically have for example information like

2289
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:08,960
are you using sightings, do you use objects and stuff like that. 

2292
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,0
For example, thing that you can really look at if you want to see 

2293
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:14,480
if the quality of information that you create in MISP

2296
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:19,560
i would just following the standards what is following the best practices in the different organization

2297
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,640
is to compare with the {inaudible} feed 

2300
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,198
there are some goods even in the OSINT feed and 

2301
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:29,519
for example, things that are really a good indicator is to see

2303
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,880
are you just using indicators and using objects, 

2305
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,0
are those objects linked together by using the relationship to it,

2306
01:13:35,0 --> 01:13:40,199
are you using galaxies, are those galaxies at the event level, {inaudible} level,

2308
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:46,0
do you have tags,  labels on specific objects or specific attributes and so on

2311
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:52,960
that's different parameters and I think the question from {inaudible} is pretty good.

2315
01:13:52,960 --> 01:14:00,39
and if you really want to dive into the KPI aspect of MISP and quality of information.

2316
01:14:00,39 --> 01:14:03,239
In addition to what Andras just said 

2320
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:07,600
there are some other things about the quality of information shared within the community

2321
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,920
and there's some good examples in the MISP dashboard about the different badges

2324
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,0
there is even a model for sharing such kind of information.

2326
01:14:16,0 --> 01:14:19,0
So another thing that is I think quite useful and 

2329
01:14:19,0 --> 01:14:23,520
it was one of the core functionality of MISP was the correlation features.

2330
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:29,119
This one is, it looks like obvious but it's not always obvious 

2332
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:32,800
I mean a lot of tools in the security field exist but they don't do automatic correlations.

2334
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,679
For example, at the {inaudible} we are using ticketing system  

2337
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:39,0
and sometimes it's very difficult to find if we have two correlating events 

2338
01:14:39,0 --> 01:14:42,820
and what we decided in MISP which covers the cost. 

2339
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:48,800
I mean the correlation engine is maybe one of the costly aspects of using MISP on a database level.

2341
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,919
but it's really useful.

2342
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:52,500
For example, here we just have an example of 

2343
01:14:52,500 --> 01:15:00,500
information about some malware spam that are used to share uh information about

2348
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:04,239
target campaigns for the financial malware

2351
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:09,819
and what we can see there is basically correlation on similar points

2352
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:12,880
and those ones are mainly IP addresses of the infrastructure

2355
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,0
but you can really spot interesting things there.

2357
01:15:16,0 --> 01:15:19,679
For example, you see that the third {inaudible bone/bin} in Germany share indicators,

2360
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:24,0
you have a polish bank sharing the same kind of indicators 

2361
01:15:24,0 --> 01:15:26,560
we were sharing such kind of indicators too

2362
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,640
and even if they have different names or different contextualization 

2365
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,439
we can really spot similar infrastructure 

2366
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:39,198
so we can see okay, it's maybe the same actors using an infrastructure for different kind of things

2369
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:45,679
or for example we can actually see here that we have different names of the similar malware 

2372
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,0
so really this is important for example another thing that is interesting is

2374
01:15:48,0 --> 01:15:53,739
for example if you have a sinkhole IP address setup by a antivirus company for example, 

2377
01:15:53,739 --> 01:15:57,560
you can directly spot it. I mean if you have, I don't know, APT 29 

2380
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:01,840
and you have like three different criminals malware going on that one and so on 

2383
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,600
obviously it's usually not the same infrastructures but on the other hand 

2385
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,39
you can directly spot, okay this one is already take down 

2386
01:16:08,39 --> 01:16:12,159
it's handled by this antivirus company and you can really handle it

2388
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:20,679
so it's really a way to quickly find if it's a new threat or something that is already known in the infrastructure

2392
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:28,640
So a little bit of the sightings themselves so we're going to see this more in practice

2395
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:36,79
basically we have a very simple interfacing list that allows us to to tell the community

2398
01:16:36,79 --> 01:16:40,158
that we've seen an indicator, as well as when we've seen it

2401
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:46,238
and perhaps also include information on what tool we've picked up, what context we've seen,

2402
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:50,359
so sightings can have some metadata on top of just being a sighting. 

2406
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:54,79
We can also flag something that we call negative sightings which is a false positive sighting

2409
01:16:54,79 --> 01:16:59,0
where we indicate that we've seen it but it produced issues for us so it was a false positive.

2412
01:16:59,0 --> 01:17:05,520
We can also indicate that something is potentially going to be expired at a certain date,

2415
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,0
so this is interesting, for example, if we're in talks with a provider 

2418
01:17:10,0 --> 01:17:11,519
and we know that there is going to be a takedown 

2420
01:17:11,519 --> 01:17:17,0
then we can already indicate that okay, this is no longer an indicator after a certain point in time.

2422
01:17:17,0 --> 01:17:21,679
Apart from that if you are ever dealing with bulk sightings,

2424
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:28,0
so if you want to for example just capture any IP address seen in your network or something like that

2427
01:17:28,0 --> 01:17:34,560
there is another tool called SightingDB, which is developed by Devo, it's also an open source tool.

2430
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,79
It's really recommended to use that, it allows you to to capture massive massive amounts of data

2432
01:17:38,79 --> 01:17:45,539
so if you're capturing the entire network flow of your constituency and or your organization 

2436
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:49,920
and just dumping all the data somewhere this is a great place to do it

2439
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,760
and it's a very fast lookup database that is integrated with MISP

2441
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,500
where MISP can automatically just query it for any of the indicators that you're seeing in MISP,

2445
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:05,359
and whether it was seen in your network, and in which time range it was seen in.

2446
01:18:03,0 --> 01:18:07,500
interesting thing with that is it's also for historical values 

2448
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:14,238
so if you're just doing bulk collection of all the observables in your network

2451
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:26,500
and then even half a year later if it turns out that a indicator is being shared with you 

2454
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,0
that correlates with an observable that SightingDB from half a year ago 

2456
01:18:27,0 --> 01:18:30,0 
then you know that you might need to launch an investigation into something

2459
01:18:30,0 --> 01:18:34,0
that happened half a year ago in logs and so on based on the historic look up. 

2460
01:18:38,0 --> 01:18:41,0
Alex

2462
01:18:41,0 --> 01:18:44,500
Just complementary notes regarding sightings and

2464
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:49,439
that's something that is basically maybe the easiest way of sharing additional information

2467
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:53,839
it costs nothing and if you are connected to a MISP instance

2468
01:18:53,839 --> 01:18:56,319
and you can tell someone else that you have seen it 

2469
01:18:56,319 --> 01:18:59,900
it's really a quick thing that can be useful for many organizations.

2473
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:04,500
So the sighting itself sounds like a very small feature

2474
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:10,399
but at the end, it's a an easy one for contributing and helping the others to know

2478
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:15,0
if an indicator is still valuable and so on, so sighting is really something that 

2481
01:19:15,0 --> 01:19:22,920
can basically be a kind of of entry-level things to do when sharing information 

2484
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:28,500
Something else that we have in MISP, this one is I think becoming more and more important

2487
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,239
and we will do a quick demo later regarding that.

2489
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:37,0
It's a timeline, I mean when we do analysis and so on,
 
2490
01:19:37,0 --> 01:19:40,0
it's really I would say common to have a first seen, last seen 

2492
01:19:40,0 --> 01:19:42,159
to see the evolution of things over time.

2494
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:45,198
In the example that you see on the screen there

2496
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:47,319
It's based on specific threat actors

2497
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:54,839
that sends a significant numbers of spear phishing 

2499
01:19:54,839 --> 01:20:00,0
and those spear phishing are very well known when we collect those timestamps and so on.

2503
01:20:00,0 --> 01:20:03,0
So you can really see and trace the evolution of a specific group and so on.

2506
01:20:03,0 --> 01:20:07,500
This can be done automatically, for example passive dns records

2507
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:13,0
I have very often the first seen, last seen and automatically you can really build

2510
01:20:13,0 --> 01:20:18,0
and create this kind of timeline because it can be really cumbersome if you have to do it manually

2514
01:20:18,0 --> 01:20:22,239
So we have a nice view like that so that means every time you set a first seen, last seen

2516
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:26,0
on any attribute, object, and so on; it automatically populate on the timeline

2518
01:20:26,0 --> 01:20:31,7
and it's an easy way to to see evolution, trend and so on for your analysis

2521
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:39,280
and this is a completely interactive so you can navigate over that.

2522
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,0
We will show that later.

2524
01:20:43,0 --> 01:20:47,39
So for life cycle management, again this is something that we show briefly but 

2527
01:20:47,39 --> 01:20:49,480
we're going to way more depth about that tomorrow 

2528
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:53,519
is basically here we see some examples of some attributes 

2531
01:20:53,519 --> 01:20:58,800
that have scores applied to them coming from different scoring models.

2532
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,0
So we see there an IDS simple decaying model and then a custom model 

2533
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:08,800
titled "Model 5" that are basically running on each of those indicators 

2535
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:13,500
and they generate a score taking into account for things such as labels that are attached to them,

2536
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,0
the timestamp on when the attribute was created 

2537
01:21:17,0 --> 01:21:21,0
as well as the timestamp of the different sightings that came in so generally

2544
01:21:21,0 --> 01:21:24,0
if something is still being actively seen in your network 

2545
01:21:24,0 --> 01:21:28,0
that is still relevant despite the indicator itself being perhaps older 

2546
01:21:28,0 --> 01:21:33,520
and then using the score that gets generated from these different models that you define

2551
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,500
you can basically then make those decisions when you're exporting data to only include

2554
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:43,0
data above a certain threshold when you're feeding your SIEM for example.

2556
01:21:44,79 --> 01:21:48,500
Yeah, and this one is quite interesting because you can really define 

2557
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:52,159
so the thing that is really important with the decaying of indicators

2559
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:58,920
you are not modifying that actually you are really just updating and overlapping 

2564
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,759
and you can just define those kind of models so that means for example

2566
01:22:01,759 --> 01:22:05,39
even within a team where you don't agree on a specific model, you can have both models.

2569
01:22:05,39 --> 01:22:09,679
It's very common, for example, to have models for intrusion detection systems

2571
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:16,719
and specific models for I don't know, endpoint, {inaudible} or endpoint protection device

2574
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:20,639
and in MISP you have even a models or kind of simulator 

2575
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:25,500
where you can simulate the different model that you want to apply

2578
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,920
and to see what kind of lifetime you want to apply,

2579
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,0
when it decay, when for example you have a specific threshold where 

2582
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:39,500
basically say okay you don't use anymore those kind of data and you can do the mapping with 
 
2583
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:45,500
specific taxonomies you can with the different types, attributes, and so on

2585
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:49,0
directly in MISP and it is really a quick win.

2588
01:22:49,0 --> 01:22:53,500
So you are not bound, for example, we know that some TIPs for example 

2591
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:58,479
have a kind of system-wide decaying models in MISP it is not like that,

2593
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:02,679
everyone has their models, we are sharing some models 

2594
01:23:02,679 --> 01:23:06,0
and you can define what you want to use without really altering the data.

2598
01:23:06,0 --> 01:23:10,238
So that means this kind of of information there is just an overlay 

2599
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:15,0
and you actually keep your own data in the systems without having any modification.

2601
01:23:17,0 --> 01:23:24,0
And you can simulate that one.

2605
01:23:27,0 --> 01:23:31,0
So when it comes to starting out, one of the trickiest things obviously is 

2606
01:23:31,0 --> 01:23:34,0
when you're starting out with MISP is if you're staring as an empty instance 

2607
01:23:34,0 --> 01:23:37,198
then getting started and encoding information is really tough 

2610
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,0
because you don't know what is really expected from the communities out there, you don't know how.

2612
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:44,0
It's a new tool, you don't really know how to get started. 

2616
01:23:44,0 --> 01:23:50,239
So in order to ease this a little bit there are a bunch of different feeds some of those that we also provide ourselves

2619
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:54,500
which is obviously operational information something that you can use directly

2622
01:23:54,500 --> 01:24:00,799
so these are OSINT feeds that we produce as well from our TLP white data set 

2623
01:24:00,799 --> 01:24:04,0
and the idea is that this will really help with bootstrapping your processes.

2625
01:24:04,0 --> 01:24:08,0
Look at the data we consider that generally well-formed

2629
01:24:08,0 --> 01:24:12,500
and well contextualized. It should give you an idea of what data generally looks like in MISP.

2631
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,500
So don't start out with a fresh instance, 

2632
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,0
just go to your feed menu in your MISP when you're installing it

2633
01:24:18,0 --> 01:24:22,500
and pull in some of these OSINT feeds so that you see the information already.

2636
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,359
Also it's a great way to test your internal tooling 

2637
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:31,119
so if you want to test the APIs, if you want to test internal synchronization,

2640
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:33,500
it's good to have larger data set already from the get go 

2641
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:38,679
so that you already see that the movement of the data is working as expected.

2645
01:24:38,679 --> 01:24:44,500
Yeah, the other thing that you can do and where we're going to talk about that quite a bit tomorrow

2648
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:50,500
is basically figuring out which feeds are worth ingesting,

2650
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:55,719
how the feeds compare to each other, running overlap analysis between them and so on

2653
01:24:55,719 --> 01:25:00,0
So this is something that this is quite a heavy topic for tomorrow.

2656
01:25:05,0 --> 01:25:08,0
You're muted alex. 

2657
01:25:08,0 --> 01:25:09,500
Yeah just discover {inaudible this/MISP}.

2658
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:12,0
So as you can see for MISP,

2659
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:15,300
it's the development of MISP already done over the years, 

2661
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:19,760
based on the feedback of users and that's really one of the key elements for us.

2663
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,0
We wanted a tool for us that works 

2665
01:25:22,0 --> 01:25:28,879
and it's key and based on that we wanted something that works for others too

2667
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:33,679
and I mean the tool is evolving over time so you see that we have plenty of functionalities

2670
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:37,79
On those two days of workshop we'll try to cover a part of it,

2672
01:25:37,79 --> 01:25:41,679
we had already some good questions regarding how to customize this and so on.

2675
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:45,119
We might give you some hints how to do it and and so on,

2677
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:47,0
so we won't be able to cover everything in those two days 

2678
01:25:47,0 --> 01:25:54,0
but you'll see that you can really update MISP based on your specific use cases and so on. 

2679
01:25:54,0 --> 01:26:00,500
So MISP is there as a tool, what really usually matters and are the successful,

2680
01:26:00,500--> 01:26:07,0
I would say, sharing communities depends on the practices or you do that and so on

2687
01:26:07,0 --> 01:26:11,0
and we really want at least at the end, even if it's a complex tool and so on 

2690
01:26:11,0 --> 01:26:15,520
to be as easy as possible for covering different use case 

2691
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,500
and that's really the thing that we want to do, 

2693
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,520
is for example for a lot of things that we have in MISP 

2694
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,700
and someone just asked the questions about how can you customize MISP

2697
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:27,119
a lot of things in MISP can be customized by just modifying some JSON files.

2700
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:32,519
It's the case for MISP objects so if you want to create a new object you just update the json files,

2701 
01:26:32,519 --> 01:26:39,500
if you want to, for example, create a new taxonomies or create a new galaxy 

2706
01:26:39,50 --> 01:26:41,839
you just create those kind of json files.

2708
01:26:41,839 --> 01:26:45,500
You have other ways to update and change the behavior of MISP.

2709
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,158
it's based for example on MISP modules

2710
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:51,439
so if you want to change the behavior of the expansion and so on

2712
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:58,800
you can just play with MISP modules and we will quickly show you some examples on these modules

2716
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,80
but that's really simple I mean there's no {inaudible}

2719
01:27:02,80 --> 01:27:10,239
and that's the thing that you have to understand with MISP project is not just a small open source software somewhere

2720
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:16,800
it's really a set of combination of tool, software, packages, open standards,

2721
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:23,799
various best practices, shared knowledge base and obviously the community is using it.

2728
01:27:23,799 --> 01:27:26,500
So that's really the thing that we will have we love with FIRST for example. 

2731
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:31,0
it is to have this kind of community, learning together, sharing information,

2732
01:27:31,0 --> 01:27:33,119
and so that's that's really a key for us.

2735
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:41,500
We have, I think more than 500 contributors on the MISP project with even more nowadays.

2738
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:45,500
So if you want to become one of the contributors it's really straightforward I mean

2739
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:48,800
if you have something, a problem that you want to solve,

2742
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,400
for example on an object, you just do a pull request and

2743
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,840
it will be in MISP immediately and you become a contributor in the project 

2747
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:58,0
so really for us, it's really key in MISP 

2748
01:27:58,0 --> 01:28:02,0
is to have a kind of tool that is supporting the different use cases

2749
01:28:02,0 --> 01:28:06,238
Okay so before that, we do a break I will share you with you 

2750
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:12,759
some practical details on accessing the MISP training instance because there were some questions regarding that

2755
01:28:12,759 --> 01:28:20,0
and after the break, we will do the hands-on practical session 

2756
01:28:20,0 --> 01:28:25,359
with an example, so we will with a real example, so you will create the full event 

2757
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:27,359
based on some information that you receive.

2759
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:36,500
So first of all, I will give you some details about how to access the MISP instance.


2763
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:42,500
S0, first of all we have a {inaudible acting/active} page 

2764
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:48,500
which I obviously share at some point in time and I will share it again.

2766
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:54,799
Yes. So there's a page with some pages that you can even edit.

2769
01:28:54,799 --> 01:29:00,0
I will paste the link again in the chat for everyone.

2772
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:11,319
That's the link, so we have a 50 account on the training instance. 

2773
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:14,159
Pick randomly one

2775
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:18,0
it doesn't matter if you are multiple one using the same account but be careful

2777
01:29:18,0 --> 01:29:22,119
don't change the password because maybe some people will complain,

2780
01:29:22,119 --> 01:29:30,800
and then we have a "TrainingFIRST2021" password so super simple

2782
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,600
not so secure but that's fine it's a training instance.

2785
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:41,0
Just for the reference, for the one that doesn't want to use the training instance

2786
01:29:41,0 --> 01:29:44,0
sometimes for whatever reason you want to use your own instance.

2788
01:29:44,0 --> 01:29:50,238
We have different images, virtual box and VMware images for MISP.

2791
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:54,158
So if you want to play with MISP locally and so on.

2793
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:57,279
If you want to play with synchronization too, you can even connect those two 

2794
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:05,280
So and during the sessions we will connect to that instance so the instant is "iglocska.eu"

2796
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:14,0
and when you connect, you will get access to the instance.

2799
01:30:14,0 --> 01:30:18,158
So you enter your training password so I will enter with my specific account

2802
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:23,500
and we will use that instance for the hands-on that we will do just after the break.

2804
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:31,0
So what I propose now is to do a 15 minute break and we start at 45, if it's fine for everyone

2808
01:30:31,0 --> 01:30:39,600
and we will start by with the practical sessions with a specific email

2811
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,600
that we will share in the {inaudible} as a practical example

 2813
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:51,300 
so thank you for the one that join us now and we will start again at 45 

2814
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:54,500
to do the hands-on session. Thank you very much.

2817
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,500
Thank you.

2819
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:14,0
Okay and shall we get started.

2820
01:44:15,0 --> 01:44:18,559
Sure, welcome back everyone.

2821
01:44:19,0 --> 01:44:25,399
Okay so now what we're going to be doing is we're going to look a little bit at MISP itself

2824
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:28,500
so we've talked plenty about it but we haven't actually done anything with it yet.

2825
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:34,560
So I really encourage everyone that has a MISP instance to also play along and to create your own events.

2827
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:39,199
What we're going to be doing is we're going to go through a set of fictional little exercise.

2830
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:46,560
Assume that you receive an email from, in this case, luxembourg {inaudible} telecom 

2836
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:51,80
the CSIRT of them describing an incident, of a very simplistic incident,

2838
01:44:51,80 --> 01:44:56,479
of what happened and what we're going to be trying to do now is to model this in MISP

2840
01:44:56,479 --> 01:45:01,839
and to explain how you can further improve it and contextualize this information

2843
01:45:01,839 --> 01:45:07,0
So before we start, once you're logged into the MISP instance,

2845
01:45:07,0 --> 01:45:11,0
such as the hosted training instance. This is what you're going to be seeing.

2848
01:45:11,0 --> 01:45:14,500
So it's a little bit squeezed on Alex's screen

2850
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:21,599
but the idea is that you have a list of events that are listed on the main page.

2852
01:45:21,599 --> 01:45:25,280
So we're in the event index, this is our landing page when we load up MISP

2854
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:29,0
and each of these individual lines represents an event so they're describing either an attack,

2857
01:45:29,0 --> 01:45:39,500
or perhaps a report, recurring distribution, or a certain type of of indicator lists and so on.

2861
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:45,0
So what you're seeing here is, you have each of these events having an ID and some metadata around it 

2863
01:45:45,0 --> 01:45:50,500
so these metadata can be either coming from this galaxy cluster system that we mentioned.

2864
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:53,500
For example describing different attacker techniques,

2867
01:45:53,500 --> 01:46:00,0
different types of ransomwares in this case or attack patterns that are leveraged

2871
01:46:00,0 --> 01:46:04,0
and then if we scroll a bit further right so this is a bit lower resolution here that we see

2874
01:46:04,0 --> 01:46:07,500
but you should have it visible on the same page.

2877
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:14,239
You see the information about what this event is trying to describe to us

2880
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:17,500
it's simple to understand text-based representation.

2881
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:22,500
Now this instance is used for trainings in general so it's going to be filled with a lot of junk

2883
01:46:21,198 --> 01:46:26,500
interspersed with real data that is coming from our TLP white feed.

2886
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:31,679
So you're going to see some obviously weird events in there.

2889
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:37,199
These are just there for testing, just players playing during an exercise and so on

2891
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,500
but also some real events there.

2892
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:42,500
So what we're going to be doing now is we're going to create our own event 

2894
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:46,0
based on that email that we received it's also on the hackmd page

2896
01:46:46,0 --> 01:46:52,880
so just have a look at the email itself and we need to start encoding that event.

2900
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,0
so before we include anything in MISP, the first thing that we need to do

2902
01:46:56,0 --> 01:46:59,500
is we need to create a new event so this is where everything starts.

2904
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:04,0
Way to do it is to just click on add event on the left side of the menu

2906
01:47:04,0 --> 01:47:07,0
and then you start with a very simplistic form 

2907
01:47:07,0 --> 01:47:10,800
where we can describe the event in a very high level in MISP.

2909
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:14,500
so here you see the first step is very straightforward

2911
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:19,300
the things that we have to watch out for out here is we have to decide who gets to see the event

2914
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:21,500
so this is the distribution level 

2915
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:25,0
and that we need to set a basic description of it.

2918
01:47:25,0 --> 01:47:31,500
As for the distribution itself, you have different ways of interacting with the data here already

2921
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:34,400
so one of the decisions that you have to make,

2922
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:37,500
even if you're going to share to the wider community out there is  

2925
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:41,119
do I keep this internal until I am ready to share it with the community 

2926
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:45,500
or do I already make it visible to anyone that has access to the data in the community.

2930
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:51,500
Now keep in mind that we have a publishing process in MISP, so until an event is published

2933
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:55,118
it is not propagated out to other MISP instances, 

2934
01:47:55,118 --> 01:47:58,0
that means anyone on the current MISP instance can see the data

2936
01:47:58,0 --> 01:48:01,500
but it will not jump to a different MISP instance at this point in any way.

2939
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:06,0
but if you are creating it on a hosted instance for example

2941
01:48:05,439 --> 01:48:10,500
if your ISAC is running a MISP instance and you're creating it on that one directly

2944
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:13,0
then this already has an impact on who can see the data.

2946
01:48:13,0 --> 01:48:17,500
So the option here, either go with "Your organization only" 

2947
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:20,500
and then raise the distribution level once it's ready to be released

2949
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:25,500
or you already involve addressing the process and you pick something like "This community only"

2952
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:28,319
where others can chip in with their ideas from the get-go.

2954
01:48:28,319 --> 01:48:32,559
So this is up to you, it's a risk versus efficiency question.

2956
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:36,500
Do I want to share the information and potentially overshare a bit 

2959
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:43,0
by accidentally uploading information that is not yet confirmed that it can be shared out

2962
01:48:43,0 --> 01:48:47,439
versus losing out on perhaps others immediately jumping on board 

2963
01:48:47,439 --> 01:48:52,0
and saying okay this is also something we've seen we've already done the analysis of it here you go,

2967
01:48:52,0 --> 01:48:54,960
so you have to balance those two things out.

2969
01:48:56,0 --> 01:49:02,0
For example some CSIRT was aware of this, so when people are working on a case 

2972
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:09,0
by default it is "Your organization only" {inaudible} and at one point in time the team lead

2974
01:49:09,0 --> 01:49:13,0
for example decide at some point it's okay, now you can share it to a wider community 

2977
01:49:13,0 --> 01:49:15,0
and then you change the distribution level.

2978
01:49:16,0 --> 01:49:19,500
Yeah, indeed. So let's start with the organization only for now

2980
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:21,500
for different reasons that we'll get back to later on 

2981
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:26,500
it allows us to show off another feature afterwards that is handy, so we start with that.

2983
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:30,500
Then we have to describe the threat level so this is a very subjective question.

2987
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:36,500
Threat level will depend a lot on what sort of an organization you are versus who you're sharing it with

2990
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:40,500
so we all have different interpretations of what we consider a high threat level.

2993
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:44,500
We have some descriptions for each of these fields predefined.

2996
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:46,500
If you click on the little information box,

2997
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:52,500
it will tell you that high is sophisticated APT malware or zero day attack.

3000
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:56,0
Please just freely disregard this because 

3003
01:49:56,0 --> 01:50:00,0
nowadays a lot of information sharing happens in completely different domains,

3004
01:50:00,0 --> 01:50:04,500
so if a fraud team is sharing information about fraudster 

3005
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:11,0
their definition of high threat level would be very different from those in cyber security for example.

3010
01:50:11,0 --> 01:50:14,500
So generally it's just a subjective first measure 

3011
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:18,500
but a lot of organizations users use this to briefly filter out what they should tackle first

3013
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:24,500
so still use it with care. If you don't want to use this field, picking undefined is fine too.

3017
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:29,500
Analysis is the next field, describes how far along you've come with the analysis process.
 
3019
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:34,480
So basically with this what you're telling the community is 

3020
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:37,500
I'm just starting out with the analysis these are my initial findings 

3023
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:41,839
versus for example saying that my analysis process is already complete 

3024
01:50:41,839 --> 01:50:46,500
i'm not going to be digging more for now, I consider this complete,

3026
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:54,500
if you have additional information then obviously start collaborating with us.
 
3029
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:59,500
So just pick whichever is most appropriate for you. Let's just go with "Initial" for now.

3032
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:05,500
and then comes the most important part of this form which is describing the event info,

3035
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:09,0
so this is a brief description for analysts that are looking at the data 

3036
01:51:09,0 --> 01:51:13,500
that best described the event that you're basically sharing

3039
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:21,0
Now be brief here and be careful about including very domain or organization specific information.

3042
01:51:21,0 --> 01:51:25,500
One of the mistakes that people often make here is 

3043
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:29,500
for example typing a ticket number or ticket id in there

3048
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:35,500
so if you have a ticketing system and you basically start your investigation from your ticketing system

3051
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:39,500
sharing out something like what Alex has typed there is not very handy for anyone else

3053
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,500
nobody will have a clue what you mean with that.

3055
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:44,500
Another mistake that can happen here very often is 

3056
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:49,0
especially if you're starting out small and in turn initially you're only keeping the events for yourself 

3057
01:51:49,0 --> 01:51:56,500
and then perhaps later on you decide that you want to maybe perhaps after all share it out to a community

3063
01:51:56,500 --> 01:52:59,500
then one of the things that can really hurt you at that point is if you've used different language

3065
01:52:59,500 --> 01:52:03,500
for example to describe the event info so we've seen this very often

3068
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:09,0
instead of describing the things in English, we choose our own languages 

3070
01:52:12,0 --> 01:52:19,500
Both Alex {inaudible} and myself is hungarian, we are pretty prone to doing this in general

3073
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:23,500
and this is generally something that will hurt us in the long term 

3076
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:27,500
because once you share it out with a more international community 

3077
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:30,500
you either have to go through the effort of translating it 

3078
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:34,500
or basically make it illegible for the recipient

3081
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:40,500
So stick to something simple, simple phrasing, be as concise as possible

3083
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:44,500
but make sure that it's still understood what you mean.

01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:51,500
Okay, once you are done. In this case we are doing a {inaudible} spearphishing email,

3085
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,800
we know that it's targeting the telco sector in luxembourg and we know that we have a malware sample

3087
01:52:55,800 --> 01:53:00,0
so that's a pretty nice short explanation of what the event is about.

3091
01:53:00,0 --> 01:53:05,0
So once we click submit, we have our event created and we already see that that 

3092
01:53:05,0 --> 01:53:09,500
our event suddenly has a lot of data that we didn't intentionally put in there yet.

3094
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,500
So we see a bunch of tags that are applied to the event, 

3098
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:15,500
we see that the event already has information about

3099
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:20,500
who created the information, who the local owners is information and so on.

3101
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:25,500
So MISP basically takes a lot of {inaudible local/global} settings from the instance

3105
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:29,500
and it fills in the event when it is created with these basic datasets.

3107
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:33,500
A lot of these also involve the contextualization that we start out with 

3108
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:37,500
so it might seem a little bit pointless to immediately label something 

3109
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:39,500
that we have not even started working on yet

3110
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:44,200
but also keep in mind that very often what we do internally in our organizations is 

3111
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:50,0
we have several MISP instances that already are domain specific

3118
01:53:50,0 --> 01:53:55,500
So, for example we have our spam collector instance, we have our our sandboxing in MISP instance and so on.

3121
01:53:55,500 --> 01:54:00,500
These already define the scope of the information that go into them

3124
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:05,0
so we can already decide okay if we are on our spam collector MISP instance

3127
01:54:05,0 --> 01:54:07,500
anything that goes in there will be related to spam

3128
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:14,0
so in this case we can remove these tags because we don't actually want to include those just yet.

3131
01:54:14,0 --> 01:54:16,0
Maybe we can keep that one because it's still a draft,

3132
01:54:16,0 --> 01:54:20,500
so that means we will do an evaluation of this spam email accuracy

3135
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:25,500
and then, so we have some defined taxonomy in MISP on this instance we enabled 

3138
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:30,500
for example the workflow one, this one is maybe of interest from different organizations

3141
01:54:31,39 --> 01:54:35,500
is a generic one about workflow, what is the current state of things.

3142
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:39,500
So don't forget, in the initial event when we created the event 
 
3143
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:42,500
we have information about the state and stuff like that

3144
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:45,0
Now with this what we do is recommend to have taxonomies 

3150
01:54:45,0 --> 01:54:49,500
and you can really set up whatever you like in the misp event 

3153
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:55,500
to define the current state of this event so we keep "Draft" for this case.

3154
01:54:57,0 --> 01:55:00,500
Yup indeed, so we keep it at this 

3155
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:03,500
and we scroll further down and we see that MISP warns us about a few things,

3156
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:05,500
first of all, data is not published

3158
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,500
and second of all if we scroll a bit further down 

3159
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:11,0
we see that MISP also tells us that there are no attributes in here.

3160
01:55:11,0 --> 01:55:13,0
So this is still an empty envelope that we are about to share 

3162
01:55:13,0 --> 01:55:16,500
so MISP tells us, don't share this just yet, fill it up with data first.

3165
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:23,0
So at this point, we can start populating the information

3168
01:55:23,0 --> 01:55:30,0
So if you look at the initial document that we use as a starting point,

3171
01:55:30,0 --> 01:55:35,0
we see in there that we have a lot of information in there described

3173
01:55:35,0 --> 01:55:38,500
we see for example that we are dealing with spearphishing, 

3175
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:42,500
we see that we have an email that was received at a certain point in time 

3177
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:51,0
and we also see that we have an attacker that pretends to be working at the CEO's daughter school

3181
01:55:51,0 --> 01:55:57,500
and sending the email from a spoofed email address.

3184
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:01,500
So we can start by describing this information, by including this information.

3187
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:04,500
So perhaps one of the things that we can take here is,

3188
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:08,500
let's start with the most basic thing we're describing, an email, so let's start with an email object.

3191
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:16,0
So we're going to add an object and we're going to select email 

3193
01:56:18,479 --> 01:56:21,0
So here we see that this is coming from the templating system

3194
01:56:21,0 --> 01:56:27,500
where you can define different concepts with different fields 

3197
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:30,500
that have to be then populated using this object templating system.

3199
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:34,500
So we have a bunch of information that we can fill out here

3200
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:40,0
we see the spoofed address so we see a "From" address that we can encode

3203
01:56:45,439 --> 01:56:54,500
Okay. we also have a sample that I don't know if I've uploaded it anywhere. Alex?

3205
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:57,500
If not just pick any file for now because I think that's something I forgot to do.

3208
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:03,500
Yeah I don't know where the sample is. Yeah maybe we should add it.

3210
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:08,0
Yeah just put putty.x or something if you have it

3212
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,500
Oops

3213
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:19,500
or we can do it as a separate object, we can just do this separately

3215
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,0
Yeah, we can do a separate object.

3216
01:57:21,0 --> 01:57:26,0
Yeah, indeed, indeed. Okay so what we can already describe here is

3219
01:57:26,0 --> 01:57:31,500
we can still add the name of the attachment that we had in there

3222
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:38,500
just to fast track it a bit

3223
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:42,880
good

3224
01:57:46,79 --> 01:57:48,500
so we have a timestamp too which is interesting 

3225
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:52,319
 um

3226
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:54,239


3227
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:55,500
so this one has been received at a specific date so it was the third of.... 

3228
01:57:54,238 --> 01:57:59,0
so the "First Seen" is basically something that you can already set up

3230
01:57:59,0 --> 01:58:07,500
so it was the third of February, we had a specific time if i'm not mistaken.

3231
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:10,158


3232
01:58:07,198 --> 01:58:20,500
So in this one has been sent on, received on 15, 16,

3237
01:58:27,0 --> 01:58:35,500
we also see that that basically the attachment was spoofing the document 

3238
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:41,0
about the report about the CEO's daughter's progress in school.

3242
01:58:41,0 --> 01:58:48,500
So we can pick the file name for the attachment and that is under the attachment section in the object

3245
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:57,500
Good.

3246
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:59,0
I'm just clicking it. Yeah

3247
01:58:59,0 --> 01:59:03,500 
It is called report.doc.exe, I mean maybe it's not in the text right now.

3248
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:06,500
Ah okay, it might not be in the text, might be just in the original file.

3251
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:12,500
Sorry about that. So yeah report.doc.exe

3252
01:59:18,0 --> 01:59:19,500
Ok yeah perfect.

3253
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:26,500
And then we also know that it was received, that we have the received header ip 

325 6
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:34,0
so we can include that as well that's also stated in the email. It's 137.221.106.104

3259
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:50,500
and we even have the hostname ,if you want to include that, that was also included in the email/report

3263
01:59:54,0 --> 01:59:59,500
Perfect, so as you can see here we did not fill everything out 

3264
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:02,500
because we don't know everything based on the report but we knew some of the fields.

3267
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:08,500
We also see that each of these objects basically have some requirements and we satisfy those in this case.

3271
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:13,0
So if you scroll all the way to the top you will see that that this object had a requirement

3274
02:00:13,0 --> 02:00:17,500
any of those fields have to be filled, we've definitely met that so we can just click submit

3276
02:00:16,0 --> 02:00:20,500
and we can create our object in this case

3278
02:00:23,0 --> 02:00:27,500
so here we see MISP telling us if we create this object that's what it will look like.

3281
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:31,0
So we have in this case created our object and now it is attached to the event

3284
02:00:31,359 --> 02:00:33,0
and suddenly stuff happened here

3285
02:00:33,0 --> 02:00:38,500
so we see that each of these attributes already start correlating with existing events.

3288
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:43,500 
Now we ran this little exercise before so it correlate with some of those previous events

3291
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:48,500 
but normally if this was a real case if you get a correlation 
 
3293
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:53,500
there is either something very similar that already happened before 

3294
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:58,0
or is it something that simply might be a coincidence 

3295
02:00:58,0 --> 02:01:01,500
but it's still cause for investigation to check 

3296
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:06,500
is this something that might help me bootstrap my investigation or is it just noise that is not relevant.

3300
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:09,0
Maybe a side note because we have often the questions 

3301
02:01:09,0 --> 02:01:15,500
when you create such object in MISP, you see that can be cumbersome to create it manually

3302
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:19,500
so don't forget that everything that we do right now can be done through the API

3308
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:23,0
so you can use PyMISP, automatically do it and so on.

3310
02:01:23,0 --> 02:01:29,500
So what we show there, if you think on the API level it can be done automatically

3312
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:34,500
so if you have tool that are extracting emails automatically from the PC mailbox, whatever

3315
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,500
you can automatically do it in MISP.

3317
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:40,500
We just show the complete process manually but you can have a mix for some event

3320
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:45,500
maybe some might be created automatically and then update it manually and so on.

3323
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:49,500
Something else that might be interesting here at this point is we've encoded this object

3325
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:57,0
and we look at it and perhaps we might want to change the distribution settings

3328
02:01:57,0 --> 02:01:59,500
based on the different data points that we have in there

3330
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:04,500 
so most of these such as the malicious host that email is sent from 

3331
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:05,759
are technical information that we can share with the broader community

3334
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:12,500
but perhaps the name of the school that our CEO's daughter attends 

3335
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:13,599
is something that we don't need to share with the entire community

3338
02:02:15,118 --> 02:02:20,0
so we could reduce the distribution of that individual attribute in this object

3340
02:02:20,0 --> 02:02:24,500
so that we keep that, for example only for our own organization and for our own internal records.

3343
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:28,500
So one of the things you can do in this case is you can edit that individual attribute

3346
02:02:28,158 --> 02:02:36,500
so the from address in the object and you can set a distribution level to "Your organization only".

3349
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:40,500
In this case, once we release the event to a broader audience

3351
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:44,0
it will keep this individual attribute for an organization

3352
02:02:44,0 --> 02:02:48,500
and it will not share it out with with other constituencies

3354
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:51,500
Okay, so some other stuff that happened at this point 

3355
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:55,500
we see that several of you are creating events so that's great.

3358
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:58,0
The correlation count really went up all of the sudden so it's good to see.

3360
02:02:57,359 --> 02:03:04,0
Something else that happened at this point is the event itself got correlated to other events as well

3361
02:03:04,0 --> 02:03:08,500
So if you scroll up all the way, we see that the attributes that we've added

3366
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:10,0
are also showing us what other events we're correlating in.

3368
02:03:10,0 --> 02:03:15,500
So this is a summary of all the individual attributes, correlations from the event 

3369
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:18,500
that means that if this object is correlating 

3370
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:22,500
or these attributes within the object are correlating to it with a certain event

3375
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:25,500
and certain other objects are correlating with other events

3377
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:29,500
then this would be a full summary of all the events that you're correlating with.

3379
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,500
You can also draw a graph out of that.  

3380
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:34,500
If you click on the correlation graph you will see how the events are interlinked

3382
02:03:35,198 --> 02:03:38,500
and you can further explore this by selecting any of the nodes

3384
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:44,0
and pressing x on that to further expand it with its own correlations.

3387
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:50,500
Okay. Let's go back to the event 

3388
02:03:52,0 --> 02:03:57,0
Yeah I don't think we have a lot of correlations there, for the other events they're all the same

3392
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:06,500
Okay now going back to our little example we have now created four attributes all together

3395
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:11,0
out of the object template but we could have done this differently as well

3397
02:04:11,0 --> 02:04:16,0
what we could have done is we could also have created those attributes individually 

3398
02:04:16,0 --> 02:04:20,500
and added those to the event directly.

3404
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:22,500
So one of the things that we can do now 

3405
02:04:24,319 --> 02:04:26,500
is we can go back to our report and tackle the next thing that is described there

3406
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:27,500
and let's do it slightly differently. 

3407
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:35,500
So we also see that basically the person that is impersonated is also described

3410
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:43,500
so that is basically, in this case John Doe the teacher of the student 

3411
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:46,500
So let's just create a person object and describe that.

3416
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:53,0
So what we can do now is instead of directly describing it as an object,

3418
02:04:53,0 --> 02:04:59,500
we can first add those different fields, at least a name as individual attributes.
 
3421
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:02,500
So let's see how adding individual attributes work 

3422
02:05:00,0 --> 02:05:04,500
so we click on the little plus icon above the attribute list

3425
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:08,500
and we simply select category "Person"

3426
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:13,500
and from "Person" we select "first-name", "first-name" is John.

3428
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:16,0
and here we can already define, is this an indicator?

3429
02:05:15,39 --> 02:05:20,0
Do we want to set it for intrusion detection system flag?

3431
02:05:20,0 --> 02:05:23,0
No, definitely not, this in itself is not an indicator

3433
02:05:23,0 --> 02:05:29,0
In fact we want to also disable correlation on this as this is a pretty common name

3436
02:05:29,0 --> 02:05:33,0
that is definitely not something to... 

3437
02:05:33,0 --> 02:05:37,500
We don't need a comment for now, we're going to convert it into an object anyway

3440
02:05:40,0 --> 02:05:44,500
So what we can do is we can also disable correlation on this we don't want to correlate on John.

3443
02:05:44,0 --> 02:05:48,500
Okay, doesn't matter. 

3444
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:58,500
We can do the same thing for the last name Doe and we can basically say that this is now "last-name".

3447
02:05:58,500 --> 02:05:06,500
Now we've added these two things in there now the problem with this is 

3448
02:05:06,500 --> 02:06:04,500
if we just had attributes instead of objects is we don't really see that 

3449
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:07,500
"John" and "Doe" in this case are the first name and last name belong together.

3455
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:11,500
So if I were to describe several people in the same event 

3456
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:18,500
you would have a list of first names and a list of last names with no connection between the two things

3457
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:24,500
so it's better to use objects in general whenever you're describing multiple aspects of the same thing.

3463
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:27,500
Obviously if you just have a list of file hashes that you got from a feed 

3464
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:30,500
and you just encode those and you don't have any other information with them 

3465
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:33,500
you might as well just create flat attributes out of them 

3466
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:36,500
because there is nothing else to describe from your perspective.

3471
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:40,500
But even in that case it's arguable whether you don't want to start with an object

3474
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:44,0
from the get go but what we can do in this case if we did start with this way

3476
02:06:44,0 --> 02:06:48,500
or if you receive information in this format or your tools parse the data out in this format is

3479
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:51,500
you can select those two attributes by clicking the little check marks next 

3480
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:57,500
or little tick boxes next to them and then clicking on "Group selected Attributes into an Object"

3485
02:06:56,500 --> 02:07:01,500
and here MISP will propose, okay these are the different object templates 

3486
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:05,500
that satisfy the list of attributes that you've selected,

3488
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:09,500
there's a person object that we can use so let's just pick that one for now.

3492
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:16,500
So here we see if we were to combine these two things they would be merged into an object

3495
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:24,500
that is fine with us we see first name will become the first name of the object,last name, the last name

3499
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:25,500
so let's merge it,

3500
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:35,0
Now we basically have a person object, now we also know that this person that we're dealing with here

3501
02:07:35,0 --> 02:07:38,0
is impersonating the teacher of the CEO's daughter 

3503
02:07:38,0 --> 02:07:42,500
so the impersonated person is a teacher of the CEO's daughter

3506
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:48,0
so we added the object and we also see that we can add just another text field.

3509
02:07:48,0 --> 02:07:51,500
Yeah, just text field works, where we can describe it. 

3510
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:55,500
i just want to first disable the correlation because different {inaudible}

3513
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:56,500
Okay yeah sure.

3514
02:08:08,238 --> 02:08:12,500
Yeah that works and we just add a text, description of the identity of the person 

3516
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:14,500
we can just say teacher of the ceo's daughter.

3518
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:27,0
Okay, now we're done. We have now added the additional attribute 

3520
02:08:27,0 --> 02:08:30,500
and now we know what this object is actually about without having a description in there

3522
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:34,500
but we still just have an email and a person described in here 

3524
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:38,500
but we don't know anything else, we don't know that this email is spoofing to be that person

3526
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:40,500
so we should add a relationship between the two.

3528
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:46,500
Mow for this we can switch over to the event graph view so that is a little bit further up.

3531
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:50,500
This one allows us to create connected graphs out of our individual data points

3533
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:56,500
so we see that we have two unreferenced objects, so we explode that node by pressing x.

3536
02:08:56,500 --> 02:09:03,0
and we can draw an edge between those two nodes by clicking edit and add reference
 
3539
02:09:03,0 --> 02:09:07,500
and drawing a line between the two from the email to the person.

3542
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:15,500
When you do, that MISP will propose a list of relationship types between these two different nodes.

3546
02:09:15,500 --> 02:09:20,500
There is also a custom one there so if you don't want to select anything from the list that is fine too

3548
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:26,500
but for now we can just use the "impersonates" relationship which already exists in the default library.

3552
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:33,500
Just click on submit and now we have a relationship set between those two.

3554
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:38,500
So we started telling our story by basically having a connected graph between these two points.

3557
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:46,500
Now let's further look at our original email and see what else we can get out of the text from there.

3561
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:52,500
We also see that the malicious file was contained in the email as well as an attachment

3563
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:55,500
So let's upload an attachment now to MISP. 

3564
02:09:54,0 --> 02:09:59,500
I hope you have put in the text there or something because I forgot to {inaudible} it.

3565
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:02,500
{inaudible} Perfect .

3567
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:07,500
So as an attachment and this is where things become a little bit tricky.

3568
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:12,500
There's a quick question there on the chat i'll just quickly answer that then we can get back to this.

3573
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:13,500
Where can I create reference? 

3574
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:18,0
If you go above the attribute list there is an event graph button if you click on that

3575
02:10:18,0 --> 02:10:23,0
you get the event graph and on the top left side you click on edit and then add reference

3577
02:10:23,0 --> 02:10:24,0
Like I can show it again now.

3580
02:10:24,0 --> 02:10:26,500
Yeah that's a bit better, yeah.

3581
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:33,500
So you have this kind of gray bar there with event graph so you can basically collapse or expand it

3583
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:39,500
and then there you can select one of those reference objects you press x 

3589
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:49,500
to expand all those reference objects then you can just select one object that you want to add

3591
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:53,500
and then you can edit, add the references and then you can add specific references.

3594
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:57,500
In this case it doesn't make sense to make a second reference but that's basically how you do it

3597
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:01,500
then you select your relationship type and you can add your reference.

3599
02:11:01,279 --> 02:11:04,479
It's not the only way to do it, there's a, I would say current-based representation

3602
02:11:06,78 --> 02:11:11,500
where you can do it, we can even show it so you have to go

3604
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:13,0
It's much more difficult to understand what happens.

3606
02:11:13,0 --> 02:11:19,0
Yeah, so so there the reference that you created through the event graph is represented here

3608
02:11:19,0 --> 02:11:25,500
so you see that this object has a reference so from email to impersonate

3612
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:29,0
and here's the opposite relationship that even describes the "Referenced by" 

3613
02:11:29,0 --> 02:11:31,0
and you have the "Referenced by" on this object

3614
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:38,500
so another just mention is I think less, I would say {inaudible} and so on

3618
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:40,0
but sometimes you just when you are in the object 

3619
02:11:40,0 --> 02:11:45,500
you just want to see if you have any reference or a sign and you can quickly see that.

3622
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:58,500
So let's add an attachment now and upload the sample that was included in the original email.

3625
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:03,0
Sso we just click on add attachment we select the file that you want to upload.

3628
02:12:03,0 --> 02:12:06,500
 yeah so for the attachment in MISP you have really two models,

3630
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:08,0
you have the model that an attachment is basically something 

3631
02:12:08,0 --> 02:12:15,500
completely benign, safe and you can basically share it directly.

3635
02:12:13,118 --> 02:12:19,0
So for example you have attachment like reports and stuff like that.

3637
02:12:19,0 --> 02:12:21,500
In our case what we want to share here,

3638
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:30,500
it's a malicious sample so and that's I will take a sample somewhere.

3644
02:12:34,0 --> 02:12:42,500
Press on one {inaudible} interesting there {inaudible} windows executables

3647
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:45,0
and then you have to select if the sample is malicious 

3648
02:12:44,158 --> 02:12:48,0
if you don't do anything, what it will be, it will be something 

3649
02:12:48,0 --> 02:12:54,0
like saving report, a pdf report, something that's like supporting you in contextualization

3654
02:12:54,0 --> 02:12:56,600
could be a screenshot for example things like that.

3656
02:12:56,600 --> 02:13:00,500
But if you share a sample you have to select "Is a malware sample"

3657
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:05,0
because like that MISP will encrypt and hash a file 

3658
02:13:05,0 --> 02:13:09,500
so that means you have a zip file encrypted with a default password "infected"

3663
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:13,500
but I got to avoid classical mistake of clicking on a link 

3664
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:17,0
executing binaries on your analysis machines and so on.

3667
02:13:17,0 --> 02:13:21,500
you don't want to do that, so if it's malicious always click malware samples

3670
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:38,500
then you have one below "Advanced extraction", MISP can do a lot of things behind the scene

3673
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:33,500
when you receive a file, in this case it's a window portable executable files

3676
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:37,500
so we have particular advanced extraction for those files 

3677
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:43,500
and we can expand completely the files including resources, code segment, and stuff like that.

3679
02:13:44,0 --> 02:13:45,500
So I will upload the files.
 
3682
02:13:53,0 --> 02:13:57,0
Okay in this case this one was just like a very simple one.

3684
02:13:57,0 --> 02:14:00,500
So in this case, what do we have? We have an object 

3685
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:05,500
with the file name, the size-in-bytes and then the hash file,

3686
02:14:01,279 --> 02:14:08,500
so automatically MISP will do the hashing of the different files

3690
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:12,0
the sample itself is attached so you can basically use it 

3691
02:14:12,0 --> 02:14:14,880
and some additional ones like ssdeep for example, mimetype are automatically extracted

3695
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:22,0
just maybe for the sake of it I will just take maybe another binary

3696
02:14:22,0 --> 02:14:27,500
just for showing you what could happen with other binaries.

3697
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:32,500
Maybe that's for later for different events so we don't have the objects in this one

3701
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:34,500
because it's easier to see for the graph

3703
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:35,0
That's fine too.

3704
02:14:35,0 --> 02:14:37,0
You can show it afterwards 

3705
02:14:37,0 --> 02:14:41,0
Yeah, okay so now we have this again this kind of object attached 

3707
02:14:41,0 --> 02:14:43,0
and there's a relationship to create obviously.

3708
02:14:43,0 --> 02:14:48,0
Indeed. So in this case the relationship is to the email itself so we know that the email contained

3711
02:14:48,0 --> 02:14:55,500
this file so what we can do is we can just create relationship between the email and the file

3714
02:14:54,479 --> 02:14:57,500
and see that email contain that file

3716
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:03,500
So you see, it it's again the same model.

3717
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:08,500
contains

3719
02:15:15,0 --> 02:15:16,500
There we go. 

3720
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:19,500
So now what we can do is if you look further in the email 

3721
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:21,0
we see that there is a bunch of other stuff still described 

3722
02:15:21,0 --> 02:15:25,500
so what we can do is we can just, now for exercise sake, just take

3723
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:31,0
at least the next few lines or the next paragraph 

3724
02:15:31,0 --> 02:15:35,500
and drop the entire paragraph into something called the free text importer.

3729
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:39,500
What this will do is it will try to parse this text blob 

3730
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:43,0
and it will try to extract anything that looks like an indicator out of that

3733
02:15:43,0 --> 02:15:47,500
So this is another method of basically entering attribute into MISP. 

3737
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:52,500
So "Freetext Import", we just paste it in there and we just hit "Submit".

3739
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,500
So MISP will tell us in this case it didn't extract everything actually,

3741
02:15:57,679 --> 02:16:00,500
so we need to still go back to it and refined a bit more 

3742
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:02,500
but it extracted some of those things that were in there already.

3745
02:16:03,118 --> 02:16:05,500
So that's fine, we can just already add those to the event

3747
02:16:08,0 --> 02:16:13,500
so how does it work behind the scenes is we have a bunch of regex in MISP 

3748
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:18,0
automatically extracting information from natural text, it's one way to do it.

3752
02:16:18,0 --> 02:16:21,500
There's another tool for doing it which is part of the event report

3755
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:26,500
but it's usually a quick way to automatically extract information 

3756
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:27,500
and to see if it's already known for example.

3758
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:34,500
So what we see here already is that evil provider was basically, 

3759
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:40,500
according to the email text, the place that was used to download the secondary payload from 

3760
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:46,0
so we can take evil provider and we also know that we got an IPv6 address to it.

3766
02:16:44,558 --> 02:16:49,500
So we're going to add that to it as well and convert this into an object again.

3769
02:16:51,0 --> 02:16:54,500
So we're going to to just select that one convert to object 

3770
02:16:54,500 --> 02:17:00,0
and the object that we're going to convert it to is going to be a "URL" object.

3774
02:17:01,599 --> 02:17:04,500
Yep. all the way down there. Perfect.

3775
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:08,0
Let's just do the conversion and then we edit the object afterwards 

3776
02:17:08,0 --> 02:17:10,500
and we add the additional information that we have about it.

3779
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:25,500
So we have an IPv6 that it resolves to. We also have a port. 

3780
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:32,500
So once we're done with that IP destination, perfect.

3784
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:41,500
We can also add the port. It was communicating on port 443.

3786
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:51,500
and again everything i'm currently doing there can be done through the API obviously.

3788
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:56,500
Yeah and and finally we also have a domain evilprovider.com

3790
02:18:03,0 --> 02:18:07,500
now let's deal with referencing this to the other objects later on.

3792
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:12,500
We can still still add the additional information that we have in there 

3795
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:14,500
and then we do the linking afterwards.

3796
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:16,500
Again, we have the same problem here on this 

3797
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:20,500
because for example you see that the comment has the port 

3799
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:24,0
so that means we can just convert it as an object again.

3800
02:18:24,0 --> 02:18:26,500
Yeah and the IP belongs to that one as well by the way

3801
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:28,500
Okay great, it's even better.

3802
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:30,500
Yeah exactly.

3803
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:33,500
Just my screen that is a bit small. Okay.

3805
02:18:40,0 --> 02:18:42,500
So in this case, it's again a url.

3806
02:18:48,0 --> 02:18:54,500
And the things that we have this time the port is actually a high port.

3808
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:59,500
So while in the other one we do not correlate on on the port because port 443 is common

3811
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:03,500
this is one of those ports that we might want to correlate on already.

3813
02:19:03,500 --> 02:19:06,500
So we don't want to disable correlation for this one.

3815
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:15,500
Where as for the other one we we should disable the correlation for the other port 443.

3819
02:19:21,0 --> 02:19:26,500
Okay. Now the other thing that we have at this point is we have a secondary sample

3821
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:30,0
so if you have a second one that you can upload now.

3822
02:19:30,0 --> 02:19:36,500
Yeah I just just add the domain so I get {inaudible}. Okay.

3824
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:39,500
so what do you want {inaudible}

3825
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:44,500
So we still have another file to update and we have a CVE that was also mentioned in the email.

3828
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:51,0
Okay. CVE is an interesting one, we have single attributes for CVE

3830
02:19:51,0 --> 02:19:53,500
but sometimes you want to have some more information 

3831
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:57,500
so what you could do there is to create a simple attribute

3832
02:19:57,500 --> 02:20:01,500
so the CVE is "Payload delivery" in this case.

3836
02:20:02,719 --> 02:20:07,500
We have "Type" which is "Vulnerability" and usually a "Vulnerability" is defined by CVE

3838
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:13,500
you can use other value but the best practice is the obviously to use CVE.

3841
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:19,500
It's a very old CVE, those kind of attackers are always reusing those kind of old things

3843
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:23,500
but you know, it works. You know people never patch their Windows. 

3846
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:26,0
This one is interesting because you know it was exploited

3847
02:20:26,0 --> 02:20:33,500
so I would add the IDS flag because it may be interesting to look into your system for additional ones.

3851
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:35,0
So in this case, what do we have? 

3852
02:20:35,0 --> 02:20:41,500
We have again, a single attribute, which is not the nice thing that you want to have

3853
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:45,500
is basically you want to have as much context as you want for those kind of investigation.

3857
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:52,500
Luckily on this instance, we have one of those expansion modules

3860
02:20:52,500 --> 02:20:56,500
and why the "CVE Advanced" is empty, that is quite interesting.

3861
02:20:56,500 --> 02:21:01,500
Ok, great. So and then you have some additional information

3862
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:07,500
in this case we have some description, so what I can do in this in this one is

3866
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:13,0
so you see that we have either the overlay thing 

3867
02:21:13,0 --> 02:21:17,0
so in MISP modules, someone was asking about extension of MISP.

3870
02:21:17,0 --> 02:21:20,500
This is one way. You have this overlay things where you can basically just do expansions

3873
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:23,500
and see okay contextual information 

3874
02:21:23,500 --> 02:21:27,500
but sometimes you just want to have a bit more than just contextual information.

3876
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:33,500
You want to have the associated object there 

3878
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:39,500
so there you have this kind of explosion there and you can add the enrichment

3881
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:41,500
I'll give a try on that one

3883
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:45,500
Okay great. So there's something wrong on this machine

3884
02:21:45,500 --> 02:21:51,500
That's great. I'll take the other one but this is not an object but that's fine we can just like...

3887
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:57,0
Yeah, we got some attribute in this case so we have basically the description

3890
02:21:57,0 --> 02:22:04,500
that coming from the enrichment and what we can do is to then make an object called "Vulnerability"

3894
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:09,500
and "id", it's not a "credit" in this case is the "description"

3896
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:15,500
and make an object of it. Usually you should have a full expansion there

3898
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:20,500
but I didn't test it on the training instance maybe something is broken on that instance.

3901
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:25,500
Okay so now what do we have is more contextual information.  

3904
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:30,500
We start with a story and we see that we have an email we have a first url,

3905
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:33,500
a second one which is a download and a specific CVE.

3907
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:36,0
So maybe now we can go back to the...

3908
02:22:36,0 --> 02:22:40,500
We still miss one thing which was a secondary file that was downloaded.

3909
02:22:38,79 --> 02:22:42,239

3910
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:43,500
Oh okay. The secondary files, yes.

3912
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:51,500
Yeah. So according to story what happens was the initial sample was when executed

3915
02:22:51,500 --> 02:22:55,500
was downloading a secondary sample and that one was basically 

3919
02:22:55,500 --> 02:23:00,500
then used to exfiltrate data from from the system.

3920
02:23:00,719 --> 02:23:07,0
Yes, so this was a {inaudible} malicious file okay then I will add...


3923
02:23:07,0 --> 02:23:12,0
Yeah just another file and we just pretend it's the one that we were supposed to use.

3926
02:23:12,0 --> 02:23:19,0
Why is this one makes sense, it's an Emotet one {inaudible}, that makes sense.

3930
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:24,0
so now we have all these different objects in our event 

3931
02:23:24,0 --> 02:23:26,0
and it's time to build the story out of it as Alex has mentioned.

3932
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:29,500
So it's time to go back to our event graph.

3935
02:23:34,0 --> 02:23:38,500
And basically so far the story is that we got an email.

3938
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:44,500
The email was impersonating a person and we basically got a primary sample out of it. 

3939
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:52,500
That primary sample then reaches out to evilprovider.com to download a secondary sample.

3942
02:23:52,500 --> 02:24:03,500
So we have a relationship between the file which "downloads-from". "downloads-from" yeah.

3946
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:05,500
Perfect.

3947
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:12,500
from "evilprovider" and then "evilprovider" downloads the secondary sample

3950
02:24:19,0 --> 02:24:40,0
which is in this case "index.html.1" and this one then exfiltrates to another evilprovider url.

3953
02:24:51,0 --> 02:24:55,500
Now there's one thing we missed in the story here is that the first one try 

3955
02:24:55,500 --> 02:25:59,0
so in this case "trilog.exe" was actually abusing the CVE that

3956
02:25:59,0 --> 02:25:08,500
that Alex has already expanded so we have an abuser's relationship from "trilog.exe" to vulnerability.

3961
02:25:14,0 --> 02:25:17,0
So and once we're done with this we already see the entire story in this graph.

3963
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:22,500
So even if you have no idea about what happened in the report and you don't read the original report

3966
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:29,0
by just looking at this graph you can clearly read it out in simple sentences.

3969
02:25:29,0 --> 02:25:33,500
We see email impersonator a person, John. Email contains "trilog.exe"

3970
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:40,500
and that exploits the vulnerability. Downloads from evilprovider.com, "index.html.1".

3974
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:43,0
which exfiltrates to a url.

3975
02:25:43,0 --> 02:25:48,500
So it's a very simple story to comprehend without us knowing the original data information

3978
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:53,500
and without us having even having to look at the individual indicators further below.

3982
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:58,500
So this is when we're talking about information sharing we're basically sharing on two layers.

3985
02:25:59,40 --> 02:26:03,500
One of the layers is sharing with machines so informing an IDS about things to alert on

3988
02:26:04,79 --> 02:26:06,500
and at the same time we're sharing with analysts 

3989
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:09,500
that want to really understand what the threat actor was doing in this case

3992
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:11,500
and what happened during the incident.

3993
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:17,500
However at this stage, we have described our event but we're still missing something at this point.

3996
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:23,0
We still haven't actually contextualized the information with everything else that we know about it.

3999
02:26:23,0 --> 02:26:30,0
So we have vocabularies at our disposal, we have the ATTACK matrix at our disposal

4002
02:26:30,0 --> 02:26:32,0
So let's start going through the individual attributes 

4004
02:26:32,0 --> 02:26:35,500
and let's start to attach those different labels to the data 

4007
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:42,500
so first of all if we look at perhaps, which one should we start with?

4010
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:45,500
Let's not do everything. Let's look at the original email for example.

4012
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:48,500
We know that the original email deals with phishing.

4014
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:51,500
Now ATTACK has a pattern that describes phishing 

4015
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:57,500
so we can just attach the galaxy cluster of attack to the attributes in there.

4018
02:26:57,500 --> 02:27:01,500
So we use cluster yeah.

4019
02:27:01,500 --> 02:27:06,0
and we can just use ATTACK. mitre-attack, perfect.

4020
02:27:06,0 --> 02:27:09,500
and we can click on "Attack Pattern" then we get the attack matrix 

4023
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:17,500
and here we can select "Phishing". It should be in...

4026
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:20,500
Yeah there it is perfect.

4027
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:28,500
So we attach it. We refresh and there we see it is now attached to the attribute

4030
02:27:28,500 --> 02:27:32,500
and if we generate a heat map now out of the events if we scroll up.

4033
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:36,500
We have an attack matrix view next to the event graph.

4035
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:43,0
If we click on that one now we now see that as a first overview already we know

4036
02:27:43,0 --> 02:27:46,500
without looking at any of the details we see that we're dealing with phishing here.

4040
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:49,500
So this is one of the attack patterns that we've described.

4041
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:52,0
let's see what other attack patterns from attack we can describe

4043
02:27:52,0 --> 02:27:55,0
You also see that there is automated exfiltration happening.

4046
02:27:55,0 --> 02:28:00,0
So if we go to the secondary url, so another evilprovider.com.

4049
02:28:03,0 --> 02:28:05,500
We can attach the pattern there as well.

4050
02:28:05,500 --> 02:28:10,500
now we can choose to do a single attribute what we're doing or we can just select all 4


4053
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:13,500
and attach the cluster to all 4 for let's just do one for now, it's enough.

4056
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:24,0
Watch out it's... Yeah, perfect. And just pick "Automated Exfiltration".

4058
02:28:24,0 --> 02:28:27,0
It's the first one on the... Yeah.

4060
02:28:30,0 --> 02:28:35,500
Okay so now we've attached some attack patterns, we could attach it to the sample as well.

4063
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:39,0
What the sample is doing but we're not going to go through all that effort

4065
02:28:39,0 --> 02:28:43,500
Let's look at some type of contextualization for example... 

4069
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:47,500
maybe this then it's a matter of taste again regarding 

4073
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:51,500
at which level you want to attach the galaxy 

4074
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:58,500
there is really the topic is a matter of phishing at a global level, usually we can add a galaxy there

4075
02:28:58,500 --> 02:29:03,500
and then for example add MITRE ATTACK directly there

4076
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:09,500
and select the pattern phishing then the techniques there directly.

4078
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:14,500
so you have different options usually we recommend to make it at attribute level

4081
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:21,500
but in some case you don't even know which attribute level it applies then you select the event level.

4084
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:26,500
Exactly. So that's indeed a good point if you know that the entire chain of what you're describing

4087
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:34,500
references to a single contextualization, be it label, be it a galaxy cluster then indeed 

4090
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:39,500
what we assume is anything that you label on the event level is inherited by all 

4091
02:29:39,500 --> 02:29:43,500
data contained within unless explicitly overwritten by the opposite tag basically.

4095
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:51,500
So indeed that's the case. In this case we're kind of in a weird situation 

4096
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:55,500
because we're describing the full chain of the attack which includes initial phishing attempt

4100
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:59,500
but also includes the secondary payload and the exfiltration and so on

4103
02:29:59,500 --> 02:30:03,500
and if we do this on the attribute level as oppose to the event level
 
4106
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:08,0
then you're really only describing which part deals with the phishing 

4107
02:30:08,0 --> 02:30:11,500
which part deals with the actual exfiltration and so on.

4111
02:30:11,500 --> 02:30:16,0
So this is really up to you. What we generally recommend is don't just do it on the event level.

4114
02:30:16,0 --> 02:30:19,500
So if you're describing more concepts in a single event 

4115
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:22,0
make sure that you contextualize individual parts of it

4118
02:30:22,0 --> 02:30:26,500
because one of one of the things that we use these labels for as well is Searches.


4120
02:30:26,500 --> 02:30:29,500
so if I were to search for all indicators that relate to phishing

4121
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:36,500
I might not want to get the secondary payloads artifacts included in that response.

4125
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:40,500
because that was just the initial vector of getting into the network of the victim

4128
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:44,500
whatever happens afterwards is not directly related to the phishing.

4130
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:47,500
So keep that in mind as well. something else...

4132
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:52,500
Yeah so just something that you have to keep in mind too it's about 

4133
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:58,500
which classification to choose or which contextualization source you want to use.

4138
02:30:58,500 --> 02:31:01,500
On this instance, we have already a lot of things enabled 

4139
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:07,500 
and if for example you go for taxonomy. You have a lot of taxonomy that is describing phishing.

4143
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:15,500
For example you have even a complete taxonomy about the kind of phishing you have and so on.

4147
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:20,500
So when you install your MISP instance and you start to make it operational

4149
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:24,500
you really have to decide what kind of taxonomy you want to use

4151
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:29,500
in this case we have already a lot of things are available by default

4153
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:36,500
so the phishing taxonomy itself is a complete one coming from I think {inaudible} academic paper

4155
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:38,0
where we have all the techniques that are used.

4157
02:31:38,0 --> 02:31:45,500
So for example you can say that this one is coming from a spearphishing

4159
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:51,500
which was described there and you have the different techniques.

4161
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:53,500 
So in this case it's email spoofing 

4162
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:57,760
and you can go deeper there into the description of what is exactly the phishing.

4165
02:31:58,719 --> 02:32:05,500
and you can mix match both. I mean Andras selected the ATTACK phishing techniques

4167
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:07,0
at specific indicator level

4169
02:32:07,0 --> 02:32:12,500
Maybe another analyst would want to classify it and maybe the objectives might be different.

4172
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:16,500
Maybe on one, for example it's more specific for tools.

4174
02:32:16,719 --> 02:32:21,500
But if you want to run out statistics at the end of, I don't know, quarterly meetings 

4177
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:25,500
and say okay, how many spearfishing that you receive or maybe emails spoofing.

4179
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:30,0
For example if you can control better emails spoofing, the SPF record and so on

4181
02:32:30,0 --> 02:32:34,0
you can just look at the current technique that are used by by the attacker.


4184
02:32:34,0 --> 02:32:39,500
So you see that those kind of, it's full of taxonomies that can be used

4187
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:44,0
and obviously we usually recommend to not enable everything 

4189
02:32:44,0 --> 02:32:47,500
but just pick what you really want and some are very generic,

4191
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:53,0
some are more advanced but that's maybe something that we dig into more afterwards

4193
02:32:53,0 --> 02:32:58,500
but just be careful of which kind of taxonomy you want to use because it will be the language

4196
02:32:58,500 --> 02:33:05,500
that you use with the community and your partners for sharing this information.

4200
02:33:09,0 --> 02:33:13,500
Maybe something interesting to look into the email and that's linked to classifications

4202
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:15,500
but there's this comment there

4204
02:33:16,0 --> 02:33:19,0
"Please be mindful that this is an ongoing investigation 

4206
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:24,0
and we would like to avoid informing the attacker of the detection 

4207
02:33:24,0 --> 02:33:30,0
and kindly ask you to to only use the contained information to protect your constituents".

4211
02:33:30,0 --> 02:33:37,500 
So this is kind of your language describing to you what kind of classification it is.

4214
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:47,0
And so now which one should we use so if we are FIRST members, if we are using the FIRST community

4217
02:33:47,0 --> 02:33:51,500
obviously the classification that we will use is not the NATO one,

4218
02:33:48,639 --> 02:33:55,0
or the Ministry of Defense in whatever country, it's really TLP.

4222
02:33:55,0 --> 02:34:05,500
So then again based on that, we will look into different taxonomy that we have

4223
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:09,200


4224
02:34:05,500 --> 02:34:11,500
we can look for TLP and I should not do that like that.

4226
02:34:12,0 --> 02:34:20,0
I go for the TLP library and then I have the specific taxonomy TLP

4227
02:34:20,0 --> 02:34:22,500
and then you have the different one.

4230
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:26,0
In this case they say you have to share it with your constituents only 

4231
02:34:26,0 --> 02:34:31,500
so TLP amber seems to be the most appropriate one.

4234
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:34,500
We say that the TLP Amber information is given to organization

4236
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:37,500
sharing limited within organization to basically act upon.

4238
02:34:38,0 --> 02:34:45,0
If we have the extended classifications from FIRST it includes the constituent too.

4241
02:34:45,0 --> 02:34:49,500
So I will just use a TLP but I mentioned something else that is interesting.

4244
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:59,500
In the email they mentioned that this is an ongoing investigation, to avoid informing the attacker.

4245
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:06,0
In this case, how would you inform the attacker but if you do actions on specific indicators and attributes

4251
02:35:06,0 --> 02:35:10,0
you might want to restrict that so there is another classification,

4252
02:35:10,0 --> 02:35:11,500
I don't know if this one is enabled.

4254
02:35:11,500 --> 02:35:18,500
It's called PAP which is exactly that, it's similar to TLP 

4256
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:21,500
but describing what you can do with this information.

4257
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:28,500
If we don't want to at least notify the attacker that we are doing some further investigations.

4260
02:35:27,439 --> 02:35:34,0
Maybe we want to restrict that and the PAP is really telling you 

4261
02:35:34,0 --> 02:35:36,500
what are the permissive action that you can do.

4265
02:35:36,500 --> 02:35:43,500
In our case, "PAP: RED" for example, non-detectable actions only and that's really what we wants

4268
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:48,500
because the reporter say okay we have an ongoing investigation 

4269
02:35:48,500 --> 02:35:51,500
so you don't want the other parties are informed.

4272
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:56,500
So in this case, I will use RED and again this is used at event level

4274
02:35:56,500 --> 02:36:00,500
and that's something quite important because MISP will take care of that.

4276
02:36:00,478 --> 02:36:04,500
You don't need to set "PAP: RED" on every single attribute.

4278
02:36:04,639 --> 02:36:11,500
Behind, it's really at event level so it's automatically allocating on all attributes

4281
02:36:11,500 --> 02:36:15,500
We don't show it on the interface because it will be too cramp.

4283
02:36:16,0 --> 02:36:21,500
You know, overloaded with information but we do it in a way that's on the API level.

4285
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:25,500
If you do {inaudible} search. for example on event level or attribute level

4287
02:36:25,500 --> 02:36:32,500
"PAP: RED" will be included there if you have an attribute containing some information

4288
02:36:32,500 --> 02:36:38,500
automatically tags like "PAP: RED" will be then included into the information.

4292
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:41,500
So that's something to keep in mind when we have information from third party

4294
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:45,0
is to to wonder okay what is the classification scheme 

4295
02:36:45,0 --> 02:36:49,500
so sometimes they don't say a specific classification to use that you just use natural language

4299
02:36:49,500 --> 02:36:54,500
or just a normal sentence to describe all the information should be shared.

4300
02:36:54,500 --> 02:36:58,500
So the interesting thing here is that what we've seen now is 

4303
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:01,0
we've contextualized information in many different aspects 

4306
02:37:01,0 --> 02:37:07,500
and this is just scraping the top layer basically

4307
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:09,0
we could go much much further with contextualization.

4308
02:37:09,0 --> 02:37:14,500
Imagine for example describing how this information is relevant to whether it's used.

4311
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:18,0
What sort of mechanisms they should have in place to be able to block this information?

4313
02:37:18,0 --> 02:37:21,500
How can you make this useful? Think of different maturity organizations as well 

4316
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:26,500
when you're sharing information. You could also describe information about who's behind it,

4318
02:37:26,500 --> 02:37:29,0
what the motivations are? So we did not describe the threat actor

4321
02:37:29,0 --> 02:37:32,0
because we haven't done any analysis yet. 

4323
02:37:32,0 --> 02:37:36,500
This is the initial information we got from a CSIRT that just reported an incident to us

4325
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:41,500
but we could go further and if we did our analysis we would find who's behind this

4327
02:37:41,500 --> 02:37:46,500
we could go for information with the threat actor, we could look at target sectors

4330
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:53,500
we could look at a lot of different information in regards to to further contextualizing the information.

4334
02:37:58,0 --> 02:38:00,500
So in this case we could also, for example say that's in the {inaudible} where

4336
02:38:00,500 --> 02:38:04,500
because we know that this is something that was targeting an organization in Luxembourg.

4339
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:09,500 
We know there is also a sector taxonomy that you can use 

4340
02:38:09,500 --> 02:38:12,500
so that's not a galaxy but the taxonomy.

4343
02:38:12,500 --> 02:38:16,0
So we can also add for example information about the financial sector

4345
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:19,500
We know the CEO is a CEO of a financial sector organization.

4347
02:38:20,79 --> 02:38:23,500
So we could also say that it's probably has to do with that as well.

4349
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:25,500
Maybe it's not enabled, sorry about that.

4350
02:38:25,500 --> 02:38:32,0
Yeah this one never. But if you search... Yeah, exactly, there.

4351
02:38:32,0 --> 02:38:34,500
If you just search for "sector", it should be there.

4353
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:40,500
Yeah but I'm... Yeah there's something that you can do talk about it later but it's... 

4355
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:45,0
"sector" so we have different one.

4357
02:38:45,0 --> 02:38:50,500
Maybe you find that so if... there was one for finance you can just pick that, yeah.

4360
02:38:50,500 --> 02:38:56,500
Yeah, something else you can do and this one is important too,

4361
02:38:56,500 --> 02:39:00,500
it's going a bit further than the email. So for example, as a source

4363
02:38:59,40 --> 02:39:04,0
we receive emails from various people, I mean if I receive an email from, 

4366
02:39:04,0 --> 02:39:07,000
I don't know, from an analyst from, I don't know, he is at Mcafee and so on,

4367
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:13,500
that I'm working with them for years my confidence on this information is quite high.

4372
02:39:13,500 --> 02:39:19,0
On the other hand, if I receive an email from someone unknown maybe my confidence will be a bit different.

4376
02:39:19,0 --> 02:39:23,500
So in MISP, you have plenty of taxonomies to express confidence.

4378
02:39:23,500 --> 02:39:31,500 
For example, the one that is actively used, for example, the military network is Admiralty Scale or NATO scale

4381
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:36,500
where you can basically define the credibility of the source.

4383
02:39:36,500 --> 02:39:43,500
In this case, we can say that we know the source and is usually reliable so that's the source itself.

4387
02:39:43,500 --> 02:39:51,500
and we can say for this specific information that is probably true because they send us some evidence.

4391
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:59,500
Now if I have like three emails talking about the same case maybe my level of credibility will increase

4395
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:03,500
because we have multiple people that have seen exactly the same kind of thing

4397
02:40:03,500 --> 02:40:06,500
So in this case I will have those kind of information there

4398
02:40:06,500 --> 02:40:11,500
Again it's a way to really contextualize information and the quality of the information

4402
02:40:11,500 --> 02:40:19,500
and you have, for example, additional one like, for example, we have one called "estimative-language".

4403
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:23,500
so this one is more coming from DNI and the CIA.

4407
02:40:23,500 --> 02:40:26,500
It's like the likelihood of probability that this happen.

4409
02:40:27,439 --> 02:40:31,0
So we can say that this one has been almost certain and then we can even qualify

4412
02:40:31,0 --> 02:40:37,0
or own analysis judgment on this and I can say that it was like quickly done

4414
02:40:37,0 --> 02:40:40,500
and it's not perfect, I will just say low for example.

4417
02:40:40,500 --> 02:40:43,500
So then you can have this kind of information. 

4418
02:40:42,318 --> 02:40:47,500
And you can either use it as an event level again or a specific attribute.

4420
02:40:46,318 --> 02:40:52,500
So for example, if one of the emails it was like, not properly collected or it was skirts,

4423
02:40:52,500 --> 02:40:55,500
or someone modified the headers and so on, maybe you can reduce

4425
02:40:55,500 --> 02:40:59,500
the summative language of the confidence level that you have 

4429
02:40:59,500 --> 02:41:06,500
in the analytic judgment of the specific evidence or element by tagging that at the attribute level.

4431
02:41:06,500 --> 02:41:11,500
So again, those kind of information that we are putting there are factors and so on and more like event level.

4434
02:41:11,500 --> 02:41:15,500
But if you have really specific things that need to be changed

4436
02:41:15,500 --> 02:41:22,500 
or that are specific to the attribute or object then you can change it at the attribute level.

4439
02:41:26,0 --> 02:41:29,500
Just some other thing on the user interface that might be useful too that we skipped.

4442
02:41:29,500 --> 02:41:34,500
On the metadata of the event you have plenty of information there.

4444
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:39,0
Why that is interesting regarding "organization only" and "distribution",

4446
02:41:39,0 --> 02:41:41,500
In this case, we just distribute to the organization 

4449
02:41:41,500 --> 02:41:45,500
but if you have pretty large event at some point in time and you want to distribute.

4450
02:41:45,500 --> 02:41:51,500
You have this kind of overview there which is helping you to see at which level you share this information

4453
02:41:51,500 --> 02:41:56,500
In this case, it's super easy. We just distribute it to the training organization, that's fine.

4456
02:41:56,500 --> 02:42:00,500
But if you have a pretty large instance with a lot of organization and so on

4458
02:42:00,500 --> 02:42:06,500
It will display you a full graph of where the information will flow and will be distributed.

4461
02:42:08,0 --> 02:42:14,500
Okay. Now going back to our event, basically the reason why we went so deeply into the contextualization part

4464
02:42:14,500 --> 02:42:21,500
is looking at this event we can already use this right away when feeding our tools,

4467
02:42:20,0 --> 02:42:26,500
when doing our searches, to basically search for anything targeting the financial sector for example.

4472
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:34,0
we can search for anything related to phishing and find the data contained in this particular event

4475
02:42:34,0 --> 02:42:46,500
So this already helps us with our filtering mechanisms. 

4476
02:42:46,500 --> 02:42:46,500
As for PAP and TLP, those tags we can use when we make decisions on which tools we feed the data to

4480
02:42:46,500 --> 02:42:49,500
or which partners we share the information within the case of TLP.

4482
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:54,500
So we're going to see that more tomorrow when we're creating synchronization links with other instances.

4486
02:42:54,500 --> 02:43:01,0
We can for example set restrictions on TLP when we're pushing data to another node and we can say 

4489
02:43:01,0 --> 02:43:07,500
okay, no matter what distribution setting don't send anything TLP Amber in this direction for example.

4493
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:13,500
Yeah, as an example there's a very good open source tool called TheHive for threat hunting 

4497
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:17,0
and they use PAP to know which kind of actions they can do on the data.

4498
02:43:17,00 --> 02:43:24,0
So if you synchronize MISP with TheHive instance you can really be sure that 

4501
02:43:24,0 --> 02:43:30,0
what you set as PAP for example "RED" on the MISP instance will not generate issues

4503
02:43:30,0 --> 02:43:34,500
when you are starting to expansion within Cortex on TheHive 

4506
02:43:34,500 --> 02:43:38,500 
to be sure that the information is not basically flowing somewhere else.

4508
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:45,500
So at this point something that we didn't do so far is we did not include the initial email.

4510
02:43:45,500 --> 02:43:48,0
So what we're going to do now is we're going to use another functionality of MISP 

4513
02:43:48,0 --> 02:43:52,500
that we haven't talked much about called the report, the event report.

4514
02:43:51,200 --> 02:44:00,0
We can also include clear text information such as a report description and so on together with the event.

4518
02:44:00,398 --> 02:44:04,500
So what we're going to do now is something very simple, we're not going to write our own report.

4520
02:44:04,500 --> 02:44:07,500
We have a report already available from the original source 

4523
02:44:07,500 --> 02:44:11,0
so we're just going to paste that entire email in.

4525
02:44:14,0 --> 02:44:17,0
Okay. Just submit for now.

4527
02:44:26,0 --> 02:44:33,500
So now if you look at our email report we just have a simple report here in clear text.

4529
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:36,500
We're going to see an example what you can do with this. So this is all in markdown

4531
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:41,500
so you could go into edit mode and pretty it up, add additional information there.
 
4535
02:44:41,500 --> 02:44:46,0
We're not going to do that now because we're going to just look at an example that already has that

4538
02:44:46,0 --> 02:44:51,0
but before we do that let's get back to our event and let's assume that we're done this entire process.

4541
02:44:51,0 --> 02:44:55,500
We have our report, we have our event we have contextualized all our data 

4542
02:44:55,500 --> 02:44:57,500
and let's publish it now to the community.

4546
02:44:57,500 --> 02:45:04,500
So when it comes to publishing we have different ways of achieving that in MISP. 

4549
02:45:04,500 --> 02:45:07,500
By default, when we create an event like this, at this stage

4550
02:45:07,500 --> 02:45:11,500
we have all the data contained that we want to share out and that we want to use

4553
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:18,500
however MISP considers this to be non-final, it is not to be used by automation tools connected to MISP,

4557
02:45:18,500 --> 02:45:24,500
it is not going to be synchronized out to other instances and so on.

4560
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:31,500
And what we can do now is first of all we need to decide how we shared it out

4562
02:45:31,500 --> 02:45:35,500
it is the organization only for now so even if we were to publish it

4564
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:40,500
would still only be pushed to our own tools that connect to our MISP

4565
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:45,500
but it would not be made visible to other organizations but we want to change this, in this case.

4569
02:45:45,500 --> 02:45:51,500
However, let's assume that we are an organization that does not wish to reveal

4572
02:45:51,500 --> 02:45:58,500
that we were involved in this entire incident. We just want to entrust the third party with doing it.

4575
02:45:58,500 --> 02:46:02,500
So as you see there, where Alex is hovering. We basically have several options here.

4578
02:46:02,500 --> 02:46:07,0
We can either publish the event which means we initiate the entire exchange with other instances

4580
02:46:07,0 --> 02:46:12,500
if the distribution allows it. It will alert everyone that we have published this

4584
02:46:12,500 --> 02:46:17,0
or alternatively we can delegate the publishing to third party and stay anonymous ourselves

4586
02:46:17,0 --> 02:46:22,0
So let's do that option for now. So what we're doing now is 

4590
02:46:22,0 --> 02:46:25,500
we're entrusting a third party to take over this event for us 

4591
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:29,500
so let's say that we would entrust, say for example CIRCL, to take over this event

4593
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:35,0
and we tell CIRCL that we want to share this event, to be shared with the entire community.

4596
02:46:35,0 --> 02:46:37,500
so we've collected..

4597
02:46:45,0 --> 02:46:50,500
Yeah and you can see "This community only" for example or a sharing group whatever you prefer.

4600
02:46:50,500 --> 02:46:55,0
Okay, so this is again a suggestion to the other organization saying 

4602
02:46:55,0 --> 02:46:59,500
okay, we want you to share this out and we want you to share this to this community.

4605
02:46:59,500 --> 02:47:04,0
Once we click "Yes", even though the event was your organizationa and only visible to us.

4607
02:47:04,0 --> 02:47:08,500
It now becomes visible to two organizations, ourselves and the other organization

4608
02:47:08,500 --> 02:47:12,500
that we entrust in this case CIRCL. So CIRCL would get an email saying

4610
02:47:12,500 --> 02:47:17,500 
Okay, there's this delegation request someone wants you to take over their event

4613
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:19,500 
are you willing to take it over and publish it under your name.

4616
02:47:19,500 --> 02:47:23,0
This will look something like this with slightly different text we're cheating here now

4619
02:47:23,0 --> 02:47:28,500
since we're doing a training, we're site administrators so we see both sides of the story,

4622
02:47:28,500 --> 02:47:33,500
so we can either accept or discard this request. Keep in mind if you accept such a request,

4624
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:37,500
the event becomes your event a copy of it is created under your name 

4628
02:47:37,500 --> 02:47:42,500
and basically you are taking responsibility for the event from now on,

4629
02:47:42,500 --> 02:47:45,500
so also make sure that you're not pushing junk under your name.
 
4630
02:47:45,500 --> 02:47:48,500
So in this case let's just discard it 

4631
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:52,500
but we could have accepted it and then it would have become our event.

4634
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:56,500
Okay. Let's go back to the event.

4635
02:48:00,0 --> 02:48:04,0
Okay, so now the other alternative is if you want to publish it under our name,

4637
02:48:04,0 --> 02:48:08,500
what you would need to do is you would need to raise the distribution level first

4640
02:48:08,500 --> 02:48:12,0
if you wanted to involve any other parties

4642
02:48:12,0 --> 02:48:15,500
So we need to edit the event in that case and raise the distribution level 

4645
02:48:15,500 --> 02:48:20,500
to say "This Community" or "Connected Communities". Let's go with "Connected Communities".

4647
02:48:20,500 --> 02:48:24,500 
connected communities means anyone that has access to my MISP instance

4648
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:29,500
and all the directly interconnected instances including all their members as well.

4652
02:48:29,500 --> 02:48:34,500
So in the case, for example, of us publishing something like this in the FIRST instance

4654
02:48:34,500 --> 02:48:37,0
we as CIRCL have our instance connected to it 

4655
02:48:37,0 --> 02:48:42,0
so all the members of the CIRCL instance will automatically also be included in the exchange.

4658
02:48:42,0 --> 02:48:45,500
Here we see a graph of that so we see the event would 

4659
02:48:45,500 --> 02:48:50,0
be also visible to all the directly connected instances which we only have one of 

4664
02:48:50,0 --> 02:48:57,0
which is a loopback connection to "iglocska.eu" so not that interesting

4666
02:48:57,0 --> 02:49:00,500
and to everyone that has access to this current instance

4668
02:49:00,500 --> 02:49:07,0
Okay. Once we're done we can click publish and then the event gets synchronized.

4671
02:49:08,0 --> 02:49:14,500
So what happens at this stage is first of all the event will jump over to directly connected instances.

4674
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:19,500
MISP will send out a bunch of emails to everyone that subscribes to publish alerts

4675
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:22,500
that there is a new event with all the data contained within.

4678
02:49:22,500 --> 02:49:30,500
it will push the event down various local channels to other tools using ZeroMQ, Kafka and so on and syslog.

4681
02:49:30,500 --> 02:49:36,200
So if you have any tools that are subscribed to these published feeds 

4684
02:49:36,200 --> 02:49:41,500
and they will ingest the data and it will also make it available to the API

4686
02:49:41,500 --> 02:49:44,500
and to make it available to all the integration tools out there.

4689
02:49:44,500 --> 02:49:52,500
so if you have your SIEM connected to MISP, it will now be able to fetch the data contained in this event

4691
02:49:52,500 --> 02:50:00,0
So this is basically the publishing process however if at this point we noticed that 

4696
02:50:00,0 --> 02:50:06,500
okay we've now shared this event out but we've actually made a typo in the title we wanted to include

4699
02:50:06,500 --> 02:50:17,500
I don't know, a trailing period at the end of the sentence {inaudible} something like that.
 
4702
02:50:17,500 --> 02:50:23,500
in the title and we edit the event. wWat happens now is, there is a modification to the event 

4703
02:50:23,500 --> 02:50:29,500
so even though it was published, it becomes unpublished again and it needs to be to be republished.

4707
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:33,500
now the reason why we do this is whenever there is a change 

4708
02:50:33,500 --> 02:50:36,500
we need to synchronize it out to the other instances out there

4710
02:50:36,500 --> 02:50:40,0
and if you have a publishing process in place 

4711
02:50:40,0 --> 02:50:44,500
where so only certain users have access to publishing rights for example

4714
02:50:44,500 --> 02:50:47,500
then anytime your organization is pushing out information 

4715
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:52,500
it can go through the irregular vetting process so any change will unset the publishing of the event

4719
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:55,500
now in this case this is a very small change that we've made 

4720
02:50:55,500 --> 02:50:58,500
so we don't want to actually send out emails to all the other users.

4722
02:50:58,500 --> 02:51:02,500
We don't want to spam them with data that is pretty irrelevant for them

4723
02:51:02,500 --> 02:51:08,0
so we can do the publishing again but this time using the "Publish (no email) option.

4727
02:51:09,0 --> 02:51:11,500
So it will also synchronize the data 

4728
02:51:11,500 --> 02:51:15,500
it will again make it available to all different means of ingesting the data

4730
02:51:15,500 --> 02:51:18,500
but it will not spam our users with emails.

4732
02:51:18,500 --> 02:51:24,500
Okay so that's basically it for the publishing and perhaps one thing that is interesting

4735
02:51:24,500 --> 02:51:26,500
and that we didn't talk much about is 

4736
02:51:26,500 --> 02:51:31,500
we have now raised the distribution level of this event to "Connected Communities".

4740
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:36,500
So the event is synchronized out but we actually had an attribute if you look further down

4743
02:51:36,500 --> 02:51:41,500
that's had a different distribution level. So that one is actually going to be removed

4745
02:51:41,500 --> 02:51:42,500
from the synchronized button.

4747
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:51,0
So we had one that the impersonated person's email address that was set to organization only.

4750
02:51:51,0 --> 02:51:54,500
So whenever we're talking about synchronization that thing will,

4753
02:51:54,500 --> 02:51:57,500
in this case, not synchronize out. So that will be redacted from the event.

4755
02:51:59,0 --> 02:52:04,0
Okay something else that we can do at this point once we have created our event is

4757
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:08,500
we can also extract it in different formats, so if you click on "Download as..." on the left side.

4760
02:52:09,40 --> 02:52:13,0
You will see that we can basically convert this automatically to a bunch of different formats

4762
02:52:12,79 --> 02:52:17,500
and extract it in those formats directly. This is also what we would be accessing by the API

4765
02:52:16,559 --> 02:52:22,500
if you were to search for this event. We can also mark whatever response format we want.

4768
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:27,500
just very briefly we won't go very deeply into this. These formats are coming partially 

4770
02:52:26,559 --> 02:52:32,500
from our predefined hard-coded list of formats that we support in MISP

4773
02:52:32,500 --> 02:52:38,500
but some of these formats also come from the different export modules that we have 

4776
02:52:40,0 --> 02:52:44,500
So if you want you can either build your own native modules for exporting and converting data

4779
02:52:44,500 --> 02:52:51,500
or you can build modules that are sitting in another tool called MISP modules,

4782
02:52:51,500 --> 02:52:55,500
side by side with MISP that will ingest the data and then convert it to other formats.

4785
02:52:55,500 --> 02:52:59,500
So here's a PDF report that was created directly out of the event 

4786
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:05,500
and that you can just share out directly for the event.

4789
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:11,500
Something else that you can do is anything that we do in MISP, so all the process of adding attributes,

4792
02:53:11,500 --> 02:53:16,500
all the process of viewing data, you can also do that in a machine {inaudible} way 

4793
02:53:16,500 --> 02:53:19,500
by just appending .json at the end of any of the url.

4797
02:53:19,500 --> 02:53:24,500
So in that case in this event we're going to get the json representation of the event

4800
02:53:24,500 --> 02:53:26,500
Okay.

4801
02:53:28,0 --> 02:53:32,500
So that's basically for creating an event.

4804
02:53:32,500 --> 02:53:37,500
Just maybe one thing that is interesting we have a very good question from Martin {inaudible}.

4806
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:44,500
It's a quite complex one but maybe we can already partially answer it.

4808
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:51,500
So when you create an event and in this case the creator of the training.

4811
02:53:51,500 --> 02:53:59,500
People can contribute on that one but if you have an ISAC and you want to distribute back the information and so on,
 
4815
02:53:59,500 --> 02:54:05,500
one of the options that you have is to try to create extended events for example out of it.

4818
02:54:05,500 --> 02:54:14,0
So you can out of an event, you can create a new one which would be for example with additional information

4822
02:54:14,0 --> 02:54:22,0
like validations, additional things that you want to add. So you have this kind of extend event

4825
02:54:22,0 --> 02:54:27,0
and you will create automatically a new event based on that.

4826
02:54:27,0 --> 02:54:39,0
A thing that is interesting there, the thing is you can really create something completely new out of it

4832
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:46,500
and then see, so for example, for this case I can say that we did a kind of session with additional information.

4836
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:51,500
There the distribution is "Your organization only"

4838
02:54:51,500 --> 02:55:01,500
and I would add for example a specific attribute which is for example "Targeting data"

4841
02:55:01,500 --> 02:55:08,500
and I can say "target-user", the son of the prime minister.

4843
02:55:08,500 --> 02:55:13,500
So it may be information that you really don't want to share with others.

4844
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:19,500
So this one is basically a normal event with additional information there 

4845
02:55:19,500 --> 02:55:23,500
and it's only shared within your organization.

4850
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:29,500
Nevertheless, if you go to the original event, you have this kind of extended view there

4853
02:55:29,500 --> 02:55:36,500
and we can have what we call an extended view and not an atomic view

4855
02:55:36,500 --> 02:55:41,500
and the two information is combined and you can see there

4856
02:55:41,500 --> 02:55:46,500
that we have one with the information about the son of the prime minister

4859
02:55:46,500 --> 02:55:52,500
which is the extended event there. So just to answer the question of Martin

4861
02:55:52,500 --> 02:55:59,500
about the question about adding information on existing event, this is one way of doing it.

4865
02:55:59,500 --> 02:56:07,500
So using extended event is a way to qualify or extend event with additional information and so on. 

4868
02:56:07,500 --> 02:56:12,500
It's actively used, for example, for when you have two different view of the information

4871
02:56:12,500 --> 02:56:17,500
because one is distributed and another one is like the private information 

4872
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:20,500
like the forensic evidence that you cannot share for example,

4873
02:56:20,500 --> 02:56:24,500
you can create this kind of thing. It's one way of doing it. 

4877
02:56:24,500 --> 02:56:28,500
It's not answering completely the question of Martin but we can even go deeper later on that

4878
02:56:28,500 --> 02:56:33,500
but it's one way of... because tomorrow we talk about synchronization

4883
02:56:33,500 --> 02:56:39,500
there are some specific options for ISAC like unpublishing events if we do synchronization and so on

4887
02:56:39,500 --> 02:56:46,500
that can be used in some some cases for ISAC. There are many options but that's one way of

4890
02:56:46,500 --> 02:56:54,500
partially solving this kind of issues of not owning the data. It is to extend the information.

4894
02:56:54,500 --> 02:56:58,500
So I know you have something you want to add on Alexandre.

4896
02:56:58,500 --> 02:57:02,0
No, no, that makes sense. 

4898
02:57:03,0 --> 02:57:08,500
Again for the collaboration on this one, we can do various things so 

4899
02:57:08,500 --> 02:57:13,500
in the case of, you have a typo for example in the specifications and so on.

4901
02:57:13,500 --> 02:57:19,500
you can make proposal, another thing with on the interface here you see that

4905
02:57:19,500 --> 02:57:26,500
you can basically make either an edit or you see that you can make a proposed edit.

4907
02:57:26,500 --> 02:57:31,500 
So what is the use case for that? It's not like for fundamental changes 

4911
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:34,500
but for I would say minor challenges on a specific report.

4912
02:57:34,500 --> 02:57:40,0
Imagine that you don't agree on this IP Address, there's a typo 

4915
02:57:40,0 --> 02:57:46,500
and it's not D5 but E5 in the ipv6 address, so you propose the change.

4916
02:57:46,500 --> 02:57:50,500
in this case i'm playing both roles here but what do I have here, 

4920
02:57:50,500 --> 02:57:56,500
it's basically an attribute with a proposal of the change and I'm playing the both roles

4922
02:57:56,500 --> 02:58:04,500
contributor roles and the original creator then I can say, okay I accept the change there indeed,

4925
02:58:04,500 --> 02:58:12,500 
this proposal makes sense or basically discard and this is a way to get updates 

4926
02:58:12,500 --> 02:58:19,500
from supportive other members, other organizations and so on.

4930
02:58:19,500 --> 02:58:25,500
It's one way to to update the information in this case I will discard it because it's not correct.

4933
02:58:25,500 --> 02:58:31,500
We were talking about contributions, this is another way of contributing is the sighting itself.

4936
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:37,0
So for example for this indicator if for example we have an intrusion detection system 

4937
02:58:37,0 --> 02:58:40,500
and we have seen it like three times in a row

4939
02:58:40,500 --> 02:58:49,0
we can add on the interface, with the API, through the user interface, and so on

4943
02:58:49,0 --> 02:58:59,500
that you have seen that multiple times and like that you can share this kind of details about the sharing aspect

4947
02:58:59,500 --> 02:59:03,500
So what we have seen that at this specific amount of times we have the three counts  

4948
02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:09,500
saying this is a sighting and you have seen it and you can do it per organization

4949
02:59:02,799 --> 02:59:14,500
or it could be even anonymously you get different configuration in the model of sighting in MISP

4956
02:59:15,439 --> 02:59:20,0
but it's a way to see that an indicator has been seen or not.

4957
02:59:18,159 --> 02:59:26,500
If one specific {inaudible} for example a false positive you can see the negative one,

4961
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:33,500
negative sightings which basically tell others that okay this one is generating a lot of false positives

4962
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:36,500
sometimes not every organization agrees on the false positive 

4965
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:40,500
because they have different views coming from different networks and so on.

4968
02:59:40,799 --> 02:59:51,500
That's a way to provide feedback, so one is delegations proposals or another way is to basically get sighting.

4972
02:59:57,0 --> 02:59:59,0
Okay.

4973
03:00:01,0 --> 03:00:04,0
I'm just trying to go through the questions  

4974
03:00:04,0 --> 03:00:06,500
yeah maybe there are some...

4976
03:00:07,279 --> 03:00:10,500
Yeah there are some that are repeating so perhaps it's good to call them out

4978
03:00:10,559 --> 03:00:14,500
So there was a bit of confusion about how to add the email object.

4981
03:00:16,0 --> 03:00:20,0
So it is a little bit confusing so when you're in an event and you click on add objects,

4984
03:00:20,0 --> 03:00:24,0
first you need to select the scope from which you choose from

4985
03:00:24,0 --> 03:00:26,0
So it's going to be climate file and so on. 

4986
03:00:26,0 --> 03:00:30,500
Just click on all objects if you're unsure and then you can search for whatever.

4989
03:00:30,500 --> 03:00:35,500
So after you click on all objects and you type email, it's going to show email object.

4992
03:00:35,500 --> 03:00:39,500
Here the first step is more like finding out the category of an object

  4994
03:00:39,500 --> 03:00:44,500
Yeah so some sometimes you just know the category but you don't know what is really available there for you

4997
03:00:44,500 --> 03:00:49,500
So you want to see okay what sort of objects can I use in network contacts

4999
03:00:49,500 --> 03:00:50,500
and I would click on network first 

5000
03:00:50,500 --> 03:00:54,500
and then you get a list of of all tangently related objects

5002
03:00:54,500 --> 03:01:01,500
that will have to do with network connectivity but not necessarily describing the same concept at all

5006
03:01:01,500 --> 03:01:06,500
but if you don't know which domain you want to pick it from 

5007
03:01:06,500 --> 03:01:11,500
or if you know exactly already what you want and you just want to search by name

5010
03:01:11,500 --> 03:01:14,500
Just click on all objects first and then you will find what you're looking for

5013
03:01:14,500 --> 03:01:19,500 
by just typing it. So email is easy to find that way.

5015
03:01:19,500 --> 03:01:24,0
Okay so just type email and that's it.

5016
03:01:24,0 --> 03:01:32,500
Okay, other questions that were there. Okay perfect.

5018
03:01:33,0 --> 03:01:37,0
And there there were a few other questions that I answered in the ...

5020
03:01:37,0 --> 03:01:40,500
Meanwhile, maybe it's a good idea to read some of them out.

5021
03:01:40,500 --> 03:01:45,500
Yeah, indeed there was a good one about correlation graph and filtering on it.

5025
03:01:45,500 --> 03:01:48,500
Indeed, we don't have a way to filter the correlation graph 

5026
03:01:48,500 --> 03:01:52,500
but it's something that we've discussed for a while already and we want to do it at one point

5030
03:01:52,500 --> 03:01:54,500
so that you can add some filter rules in there.

5032
03:01:54,500 --> 03:01:59,00
Yes, the only way to to do it here is through the api

5034
03:01:59,00 --> 03:02:05,500
so that means you done creating one and then you have to do a filtering {inaudible priority/proactively}

5037
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:10,500
but it needs something there to be added

5039
03:02:10,500 --> 03:02:13,500
I don't know if you have an issue on that one.

5041
03:02:13,500 --> 03:02:16,500
Yeah I think we do. Yes, yes, I think we should be good.

5042
03:02:16,500 --> 03:02:23,500
So maybe you know what sometimes what we do is just to add the one on this one

5045
03:02:23,500 --> 03:02:28,500
If i can find it back so I guess you can see what kind of issue that we have and so on.

5048
03:02:28,500 --> 03:02:32,0 
A lot of the issue that we have is more like  

5049
03:02:32,0 --> 03:02:26,500
I mean around 25 percent, 30 percent are basically installation problem.

5052
03:02:26,500 --> 03:02:43,500
That's something that you can discuss maybe tomorrow about recommendation on the system

5056
03:02:43,500 --> 03:02:48,0
We don't need a lot of requirements but at least you need to have a LAMP system working

5059
03:02:48,0 --> 03:02:51,500
So MariaDB, linux systems and Redis running.

5061
03:02:51,500 --> 03:02:59,500
So obviously, for example, an Ubuntu distribution out of the box is working without any problems.

5064
03:02:59,500 --> 03:03:04,500
Now if you try to install a MISP on the MAC OS, you might run into problems obviously.

5067
03:03:04,500 --> 03:03:11,500
But what we recommend is we have automatic install script for ubuntu for example

5070
03:03:11,500 --> 03:03:13,500
and this one works works quite well.

5072
03:03:13,500 --> 03:03:19,0
I wanted to search the issue for...

5073
03:03:19,0 --> 03:03:21,500
You can just search the correlation graph, for correlation.

5074
03:03:21,500 --> 03:03:24,500
Yeah. correlation filtering.

5075
03:03:24,500 --> 03:03:30,500
Nah, that will be a bit too specific I think. No maybe not. Maybe yes.

5078
03:03:30,500 --> 03:03:32,500
We're filtering by correlation on {inaudible}.

5081
03:03:32,500 --> 03:03:51,500
Oh this one maybe. Yes. Yeah, yeah okay, this one, okay. So... One sec.

5082
03:03:51,500 --> 03:04:07,500
So that's how it works so if you see a component issue that 

5086
03:04:07,500 --> 03:04:09,500
or a feature that is really interesting for you 

5087
03:04:09,500 --> 03:04:14,500
don't hesitate to take an existing issue about specific requests and add some comments there.

5090
03:04:14,500 --> 03:04:20,500
Like for example, it's really the feature that you want, is it important for you, why and so on

5093
03:04:20,500 --> 03:04:23,500
and then we use that as a source of of doing a feature request 

5095
03:04:23,500 --> 03:04:29,500
As an example, we do a release of MISP every three weeks usually

5098
03:04:29,500 --> 03:04:35,0
and there are many new features on each release

5100
03:04:35,0 --> 03:04:43,0
As an example we had a request like that someone just fixed two days ago about the events...

5102
03:04:43,0 --> 03:04:49,500
Oh we didn't even show it. Event timeline and then 

5103
03:04:49,500 --> 03:04:51,500
we wanted to have something that is easy to set the number of days 

5104
03:04:51,500 --> 03:04:55,500
and then he added the new feature. So sometimes it makes a lot of sense 

5105
03:04:55,500 --> 03:05:00,500
so don't hesitate to create an issue and and propose a new feature.

5113
03:05:00,500 --> 03:05:08,500
Which remind me of showing you the event timeline because we didn't really show it.

5116
03:05:08,500 --> 03:05:18,500
So you see that on this one we have nearly everything on the same time

5118
03:05:18,500 --> 03:05:28,500
which is basically the time when we create the different object we just set the time for one so... 

5120
03:05:28,500 --> 03:05:34,500
and then I can basically look at this one and this one is like the..

5125
03:05:34,500 --> 03:05:38,500
Yeah, I don't know why we don't have the expansion on that one.

5127
03:05:38,500 --> 03:05:45,0
so for example if you have a specific time we can expand it and even change it in the graph

5130
03:05:45,0 --> 03:05:47,500
so that means if we have for example this email, 

5134
03:05:47,500 --> 03:05:54,0
a thing that we can do is expand it and change when this has been seen 

5135
03:05:54,0 --> 03:06:00,0
and we can even change at which time this specific model has been seen.

5138
03:06:00,0 --> 03:06:10,500
But that's again a good point to do is to automatically create a first thing last seen on your element.

5141
03:06:10,500 --> 03:06:16,0
Because every time you do that you will get an automatic timeline and actually a quick

5142
03:06:16,0 --> 03:06:19,500
I would say quick win when you do analysis.

5146
03:06:23,0 --> 03:06:28,500
So if there are no more questions about event creation perhaps one of the things we can do is show the searching.

5149
03:06:28,500 --> 03:06:33,0
How to search for stuff in your MISP.

5150
03:06:36,0 --> 03:06:40,0
okay so this is something that we're going to show very briefly now

5152
03:06:40,0 --> 03:06:42,500
and we're going to go in a bit more detail into this tomorrow

5154
03:06:42,500 --> 03:06:47,500
when we're also going to look at the api but generally whenever you're searching in MISP

5157
03:06:47,500 --> 03:06:52,500
the main question you need to ask yourself is what scope am I searching on?

5159
03:06:52,500 --> 03:06:56,500
Am i searching for individual attributes or am I searching for events?
 
5160
03:06:56,500 --> 03:07:01,500
The search filters very often overlapping or are almost the same

5164
03:07:01,500 --> 03:07:03.500
but one of the things you need to keep in mind is for example

5165
03:07:03.500 --> 03:07:08,500
if i'm searching for bitcoin addresses in my MISP instance, bitcoin wallets.

5169
03:07:08,500 --> 03:07:14,500
Am I searching for any event that contains at least one bitcoin address

5171
03:07:14,500 --> 03:07:18,500
or am I searching for just the bitcoin addresses themselves?

5173
03:07:18,500 --> 03:07:21,0
So this is when we decide between different scopes 

5174
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:26,500
so generally attribute scope will only give you the individual attributes that match the criteria

5178
03:07:26,500 --> 03:07:31,500
and the event scope will give you everything that contains at least one matching value.

5180
03:07:31,500 --> 03:07:39,0
So here what Alex did, he just searched using the attribute search for all the bitcoin addresses in the instance

5184
03:07:39,0 --> 03:07:41,500
and we see we get a bunch of them from different sources,

5186
03:07:41,500 --> 03:07:47,500
we see which events they're from which organization has created that information and so on and so forth

5190
03:07:47,500 --> 03:07:54,500
If we're happy with the search results and we've set up all our features and we're getting exactly what we were looking for 

5192
03:07:54,500 --> 03:07:57,500
maybe even several pages of it like here.

5195
03:07:57,500 --> 03:08:00,500
We can download the results in any of these supported formats 

5196
03:08:00,500 --> 03:08:03,0 
so we could say okay now we have all these bitcoin addresses out there

5197
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:07,500
generate the csv out of it and it will generate a massive csv

5200
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:11,500
with all the attribute information for each of these.

5203
03:08:13,0 --> 03:08:17,500
I hope you're not running my time instance out of memory.

5205
03:08:19,0 --> 03:08:20,500
There it is.

5207
03:08:20,500 --> 03:08:28,500
So if you open it. Just to see the results quickly. There we go.

5209
03:08:28,500 --> 03:08:35,500
So in this case, we now downloaded our search results as csv.

5212
03:08:35,500 --> 03:08:38,500
Now keep in mind whenever you're dealing with integration of MISP 

5213
03:08:38,500 --> 03:08:42,500
with other tools or exports keep in mind that certain formats don't really cater

5216
03:08:42,500 --> 03:08:44,0
to exporting certain types of data.

5218
03:08:44,0 --> 03:08:50,500
So if you're searching for ransomware payout wallets.

5220
03:08:50,500 --> 03:08:55,500
you could, for example, specify as a tag, all the different ransomware related tags that you have

5224
03:08:55,500 --> 03:09:01,0
and as a type select BTC like what Alex has done here and export the information.

5226
03:09:01,0 --> 03:09:03,500
Now when you're deciding what format to download in,

5228
03:09:03,500 --> 03:09:08,500
again, some don't make any sense so don't download bitcoin addresses in STIX format

5229
03:09:08,500 --> 03:09:12,500
because STIX doesn't have a way to express bitcoin addresses for example.

5233
03:09:12,500 --> 03:09:17,0
So just make sure that you also take that into consideration when exporting data

5235
03:09:17,0 --> 03:09:18,500
so that it's not {inaudible}.

5236
03:09:18,500 --> 03:09:24,500
Besides that we can do the same on the event level, we can also do searches on the event level.

5239
03:09:24,500 --> 03:09:28,500
If we go back to our event index, we have a little magnifying glass icon

5240
03:09:28,500 --> 03:09:34,500
where you can add additional filter options to the index and filter the database on that. 

5245
03:09:34,500 --> 03:09:39,500
So let's just do "CIRCL", we're going to just filter on events coming from CIRCL

5248
03:09:39,500 --> 03:09:42,500
and we can also add, for example, events that are not published.

5250
03:09:42,500 --> 03:09:46,500
If you wanted to do some final checks on whether...

5251
03:09:46,500 --> 03:09:49,500
We need to add the organization again.

5253
03:09:49,500 --> 03:09:52,500
whether we have any events that need to be vetted.

5254
03:09:52,500 --> 03:09:56,500
For example for our own organization, then we could use this filter for it.

5257
03:09:56,500 --> 03:10:02,0
On the event index, all of these search filters that you apply generate a specific url

5259
03:10:02,0 --> 03:10:06,500
and you can bookmark it, so if you have recurring queries that you want to monitor

5263
03:10:06,500 --> 03:10:10,0
then you can just bookmark the url and you can go back to it later on

5265
03:10:10,0 --> 03:10:13,500
and see if there is anything that popped up that matches your search criteria.

5267
03:10:14,0 --> 03:10:21,0
now generally like I think 90% of our searches do not actually happen via the UI

5270
03:10:21,0 --> 03:10:25,500
they happen via the API, so very often you have tools that you search through

5272
03:10:25,500 --> 03:10:30,500
So if you have a tool that acts as a front-end for your MISP for certain searches that works as well.

5276
03:10:32,0 --> 03:10:36,500
We're going to talk more about those type of searches and how you integrate with other tools tomorrow more

5279
03:10:36,500 --> 03:10:39,0
When we go into the api

5280
03:10:39,0 --> 03:10:42,500
There is a question about soft delete attribute search

5282
03:10:42,500 --> 03:10:44,0
I just lost the Q&A page.

5283
03:10:44,0 --> 03:10:49,500
So Martin asks "is there a way to do a global search for soft delete attributes?"

5285
03:10:49,500 --> 03:10:54,500
Yes, sorry, where is it? For soft delete attributes? Yes there is.

5288
03:10:54,500 --> 03:11:01,0
So not via the UI but via the API which you can also access via the UI by the way.

5290
03:11:01,0 --> 03:11:04,500
We have a tool. We have a built-in tool. We can even show this example there.

5291
03:11:04,500 --> 03:11:07,500
we didn't show the delete

5294
03:11:07,500 --> 03:11:08,500
Haha, that's a good point.

5294
03:11:08,500 --> 03:11:14,500
Let's start with the question first and then we go to the delete

S296
03:11:14,500 --> 03:11:20,500
so we have this built-in tool called the "REST client" that allows us to run searches directly from the interface.

5299
03:11:20,500 --> 03:11:25,500
So generally indeed we have a soft delete mechanism in MISP 

5300
03:11:25,500 --> 03:11:31,500
that allows you to to not fully remove an attribute but mark it for deletion.

5304
03:11:32,238 --> 03:11:36,500
The reason why we do this in general is whenever we're synchronizing information

5306
03:11:36,159 --> 03:11:38,799
and we delete an attribute we want to inform all the other instances 

5307
03:11:37,439 --> 03:11:41,500
that an attribute needs to be removed, it is revoked.

5310
03:11:42,159 --> 03:11:47,500
So this is why we do the soft delete where we hide it from the interface, we hide it from the exports

5313
03:11:48,478 --> 03:11:53,500
but we still keep the data and we inform the other instances that they need to also mark it for deletion.

5316
03:11:54,0 --> 03:11:59,500
Now if the question is how do we do a global search for all the soft deleted attributes.

5318
03:11:58,799 --> 03:12:04,500
So first of all what we need to do using our little REST search tool is

5321
03:12:04,478 --> 03:12:09,500
by the way we have the Modern APIs here, so to create a new API unless you know yours by heart

5324
03:12:12,0 --> 03:12:22,500
so alex because... So just quickly, so in the meanwhile what Alex is doing now is

5327
03:12:20,478 --> 03:12:28,500
he's going to generate a new api key for himself so that we can actually test the api queries.

5331
03:12:28,500 --> 03:12:31,500
Oh that won't work.

5332
03:12:31,500 --> 03:12:37,500
Yeah you can add another key from here as well, this will work.

5333
03:12:37,500 --> 03:12:39,500
Yeah that works.

5335
03:12:59,0 --> 03:13:02,500
Global action, my profile, by the way if you want to find your profile.

5337
03:13:17,0 --> 03:13:19,500
Okay, so now we have our api key. 

5338
03:13:19,500 --> 03:13:23,500
Now we go to REST client we just paste it in there now in the authorization field.

5341
03:13:27,0 --> 03:13:30,0
Here we go and now what we're going to do is we're going to run a search

5343
03:13:30,0 --> 03:13:34,500
for all soft delete attributes so we're going to search for attribute restSearch.

5345
03:13:34,500 --> 03:13:38,500
So that is a scope that allows us to search on the attribute level.
 
5347
03:13:38,500 --> 03:13:42,500
we'll see more of this tomorrow, just a small example.

5349
03:13:42,500 --> 03:13:47,0
For return format, let's pick something like JSON 

5350
03:13:54,0 --> 03:14:00,0
and perhaps set a page under limit or take one limit 100 or something like that

5354
03:14:01,120 --> 03:14:03,500
I don't know how much was deleted here but it might be a lot

5356
03:14:04,639 --> 03:14:07,500
and then just add another key deleted, there we go

5358
03:14:07,500 --> 03:14:16,0
and then deleted set to 1

5359
03:14:16,0 --> 03:14:19,0
and we don't need anything else

5360
03:14:19,0 --> 03:14:26,500
and this will return the first 100 hits from the instance of attributes that are deleted.

5363
03:14:30,0 --> 03:14:35,0
There we go And now if you wanted to paginate through all these attributes

5364
03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:37,500
you would have to just raise the page number.

5367
03:14:37,500 --> 03:14:40,500
Go back and and get page 2, page 3, page 4, and so on

5369
03:14:40,500 --> 03:14:44,500
or if we have enough memory certainly my training instance definitely doesn't

5371
03:14:44,500 --> 03:14:47,500
then we could just say give us everything in one shot.

5373
03:14:49,0 --> 03:14:53,500
Okay so I hope that answers your question Martin.

5375
03:14:53,500 --> 03:14:58,500
There is also a question, is there an official MISP docker image?

5377
03:14:58,500 --> 03:15:04,500
There are actually several, they're not maintained by us but by contributors

5380
03:15:04,500 --> 03:15:08,500
that are very active and working closely with us.

5382
03:15:08,500 --> 03:15:12,500
So I've pasted one example in the zoom group chat.

5384
03:15:12,500 --> 03:15:18,500
I don't know if maybe it's not visible to everyone. I can just drop it as an answer here.

5387
03:15:18,500 --> 03:15:20,500
Yeah, it's better.

5388
03:15:20,500 --> 03:15:25,500
So this one is done by coolacid, so why are there are so many docker MISP? 

5390
03:15:25,500 --> 03:15:34,0
That's I think the specialty of docker, not everyone agrees on a model with docker

5392
03:15:34,0 --> 03:15:38,0
so there are at least as far as I know four or five different dockers

5394
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:43,500
there's one managed by DCSO, one by CoolAcid, one by Xavier Mertens and

5397
03:15:43,500 --> 03:15:47,00
one by HarvardSecurity and I'm sure I'm missing some.

5399
03:15:47,00 --> 03:15:55,500
So the thing is for the docker images it's depending on I would say your taste

5402
03:15:55,500 --> 03:15:59,500
so have a look at what the different contributors are doing

5404
03:15:59,500 --> 03:16:05,500
and you'll see that you pick the one that is matching what you really want to do with docker.

5408
03:16:05,500 --> 03:16:12,500
Some are really more separated container wise some are more like one single container with everything

5412
03:16:12,500 --> 03:16:16,500
Again it's a maker of taste and how you want to operate one

5414
03:16:16,500 --> 03:16:18,500
we don't maintain one as MISP project 

5415
03:16:18,500 --> 03:16:22,00
but there are some that are under our MISP project {inaudible} position.

5418
03:16:27,0 --> 03:16:32,0
Someone is asking about API key to invoke cortex analyzer.

5420
03:16:32,0 --> 03:16:39,500
For the cortex analyzer, it's a separate toolset part of the HIVE project

5423
03:16:39,500 --> 03:16:42,500
and then you have specific API keys.

5424
03:16:42,500 --> 03:16:48,500
Cortex extension is like MISP module so it works for the expansion services

5426
03:16:48,500 --> 03:16:53,500
Be careful, cortex analyzer are not supporting objects and stuff like that

5428
03:16:53,500 --> 03:16:58,500
which is the case for MISP modules so you might have expansion on the interface

5431
03:16:58,500 --> 03:17:00,500
but if you want full-blown expansion with relationship and so on 

5433
03:17:00,500 --> 03:17:04,500
then you can use MISP modules. A lot of organizations are mixing both 

5434
03:17:04,500 --> 03:17:09,500
so you can have cortex-enabled and MISP modulus enabled on the same MISP instance

5438
03:17:09,500 --> 03:17:14,500
But going back to the question if you already have the Cortex API encoded in your MISP

5440
03:17:14,500 --> 03:17:19,0
and you want to invoke a lookup through the API through MISP

5442
03:17:19,0 --> 03:17:24,500
then you can use your MISP API to tell your MISP to run a query against Cortex.

5445
03:17:27,0 --> 03:17:33,500
But with the new api key models usually it's better to have dedicated API key per {inaudible}.

5447
03:17:35,0 --> 03:17:41,500
Okay, there is something else, is there a way.. we had that already

5450
03:17:44,0 --> 03:17:47,500
Could you touch on how we could use one event to add multiple attributes

5451
03:17:47,500 --> 03:17:50,500
and how would correlation work here? 

5453
03:17:50,500 --> 03:17:53,500
Configure event one to fetch all records from a  feed

5455
03:17:53,500 --> 03:17:55,0
Would this work with correlation? 

5456
03:17:55,0 --> 03:17:59,500
Show all instances where any of those attributes match with other events from other organization events

5459
03:17:59,500 --> 03:18:05,500
Well okay if I understand it correctly, indeed so if you do that

5461
03:18:05,500 --> 03:18:10,0
you create an event for a phishing feed and you have those attributes in there

5464
03:18:10,0 --> 03:18:15,500
and you have cached other instances, then within that that feed's event

5466
03:18:15,500 --> 03:18:21,500
you will see correlations both to other events created locally on your instance by other organizations

5470
03:18:21,500 --> 03:18:27,500
as well as links to other instances that have the data as long as you have cached those events

5474
03:18:27,500 --> 03:18:31,500
so we're going to talk more about that tomorrow about the synchronization 

5475
03:18:31,500 --> 03:18:34,500
but when you're interconnecting with another instance you can do it in two ways,

5479
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:37,500
one I want to start exchanging data, pushing data, pooling data

5481
03:18:37,500 --> 03:18:41,500
or two I can just tell my MISP to go crawl that other instance

5484
03:18:41,500 --> 03:18:46,500
hash all the values that they have and if I ever get the correlation 

5486
03:18:46,500 --> 03:18:51,500
then it flags it for me then it shows me that the instance already knows about this value

5488
03:18:51,500 --> 03:18:57,500
and I can pivot over to previewing the data. So I hope that answers that.

5489
03:18:57,500 --> 03:19:02,500
Yeah, and then the correlation of feeds for example if you just enable the caching

5493
03:19:02,500 --> 03:19:07,500
you just see that it's correlating with specific values without providing the full feed 

5495
03:19:07,500 --> 03:19:11,0
sometimes it's quite handy when you have for example feed that 

5499
03:19:11,0 --> 03:19:14,500
you cannot show the data but you can show the correlation, 

5500
03:19:16,0 --> 03:19:18,500
There's another one, do you recommend using MISP alone 

5501
03:19:18,500 --> 03:19:21,500
or using the Hive MISP Cortex integration 

5502
03:19:21,500 --> 03:19:26,500
I mean generally if you need a case management tool then using the Hive for that is great

5506
03:19:26,500 --> 03:19:34,500
So it makes absolute sense to use them together and integration is really smoothly done

5509
03:19:34,500 --> 03:19:37,500
so that means that no matter where you start your process, 

5510
03:19:37,500 --> 03:19:39,500
whether you start by creating an event in MISP  

5511
03:19:39,500 --> 03:19:42,500
or whether you start by creating a case in the Hive 

5512
03:19:42,500 --> 03:19:45,500
you can basically propagate the data to the other tool 

5513
03:19:45,500 --> 03:19:50,0
and work on  both tools and data. So yeah, so absolutely

5519
03:19:50,0 --> 03:19:55,0
Yeah, absolutely it's pretty smooth, just be careful if you use the expansion on MISP

5521
03:19:55,0 --> 03:19:59,0
and you have MISP modules enabled I would prefer to have MISP modules enabled

5523
03:19:59,0 --> 03:20:05,500
because you basically have all the features of MISP like relationship, objects and so on

5526
03:20:05,500 --> 03:20:10,500
with the cortex integration is basically just a layover with the Cortex

5528
03:20:10,500 --> 03:20:12,500
Yeah but one of the things that you can do is 

5531
03:20:12,500 --> 03:20:16,500
if you start for example from the Hive perspective and you push the data afterwards to misp

5533
03:20:16,500 --> 03:20:21,500
you can then go through this process like what we've done here with enriching the information

5536
03:20:21,500 --> 03:20:25,500
creating objects that affect attributes so you can do it as a secondary step

5538
03:20:25,500 --> 03:20:28,500
before you share it out to community to refine the data in MISP 

5539
03:20:28,500 --> 03:20:30,500
that you've created in the Hive for example 

5540
03:20:30,500 --> 03:20:34,500
and the same thing if you've used cortex to fetch additional information in the Hive

5544
03:20:34,500 --> 03:20:38,500
you can then take that data and further enrich it with MISP modules once it's in MISP.

5547
03:20:38,500 --> 03:20:43,500
Yeah this is a good question from Muhamad Junaid about 

5549
03:20:43,500 --> 03:20:47,500
when I try to import the data from STIX to MISP it's called lossy

5551
03:20:47,500 --> 03:20:50,500
like can you please explain that a bit and this one is interesting

5553
03:20:50,500 --> 03:20:54,0
because it's... I was saying a long long long discussion 

5554
03:20:54,0 --> 03:20:59,500
and that even influence how MISP evolved and the standard behind MISP

5557
03:20:59,500 --> 03:21:05,500
so STIX is really focusing on cybersecurity and cyber threat intelligence 

5558
03:21:05,500 --> 03:21:11,500
and the problem is you might have at some point in time  

5559
03:21:11,500 --> 03:21:14,500
data that are basically not defined anywhere

5564
03:21:14,500 --> 03:21:20,500
so it's more for the export of data so for example if you export in a MISP event

5566
03:21:20,500 --> 03:21:25,0
and you have for example an object with the person and stuff like that

5568
03:21:25,0 --> 03:21:27,500
it won't be in the STIX to export for example.

5570
03:21:27,500 --> 03:21:32,500
So it means that in MISP even if you get all the information 

5571
03:21:32,500 --> 03:21:35,500
but it's bound to the limitation of the standards and the format

5574
03:21:35,500 --> 03:21:38,500
where you export and it's exactly the same for any format 

5575
03:21:38,500 --> 03:21:42,500
I mean if you export a person in Suricata format 

5576
03:21:42,500 --> 03:21:47,500
obviously you don't have any field or things like that with person and so on 

5580
03:21:47,500 --> 03:21:50,500
so that's why we call it lossy because sometimes when you import data

5582
03:21:50,500 --> 03:21:57,500
it's bound to a specific set of fields that are supported and so on

5584
03:21:57,500 --> 03:22:00,500
Another thing that is quite important with STIX,

5585
03:22:00,500 --> 03:22:06,500
you might have a lot of peculiarities or specialities depending on the vendor

5589
03:22:06,500 --> 03:22:10,500
some vendors are adding some specific custom objects things like that

5591
03:22:10,500 --> 03:22:13,500
that are not bound to any existing one

5593
03:22:13,500 --> 03:22:19,500
so we are importing them as kind of you know generic one but it is basically like lossy again

5596
03:22:19,500 --> 03:22:23,500
so you have to be careful when you use a specific format

5598
03:22:23,500 --> 03:22:27,500
to be sure that you properly map an existing different one.

5600
03:22:27,500 --> 03:22:31,200
So it's more for the export, MISP quite flexible on that 

5601
03:22:31,200 --> 03:22:36,500
so you can basically have any object you like but when we export for example in STIX one

5603
03:22:36,500 --> 03:22:42,00
we just export what is existing in STIX even if we start we added some custom objects too

5607
03:22:42,00 --> 03:22:49,500
some which are on to the MISP object but some tools will not recognize obviously the custom object

5610
03:22:49,500 --> 03:22:53,500
because they are just having a profile for a specific set of known objects.

5614
03:22:53,500 --> 03:22:58,500
Yeah I think that's exactly the point that maybe is different from 

5615
03:22:58,500 --> 03:23:01,500
when we described the text in those import and export fields.

5619
03:23:01,500 --> 03:23:06,500
we say lossy but in reality what we do is we do try to capture everything 

5620
03:23:06,500 --> 03:23:09,500
and we do try to map everything but a lot of it will end up in custom objects.

5624
03:23:09,500 --> 03:23:16,500
Now what Alex mentioned is the problem even if we export bitcoin addresses for example

5626
03:23:16,500 --> 03:23:19,500
whenever we're pushing in STIX2 format as custom objects 

5627
03:23:19,500 --> 03:23:23,500
no other tool will pick up on it because we're just using custom objects

5628
03:23:23,500 --> 03:23:26,500
unless the other tool specifically looks for them 

5629
03:23:26,500 --> 03:23:30,500
they will just either store it as is or not know what to do with it.

5630
03:23:30,500 --> 03:23:38,500
Yeah and that that's why we recommend a feed provider or vendors and so on to actively support the MISP format 

5637
03:23:38,500 --> 03:23:42,500
then they can they can really import a full set of objects

5638
03:23:42,500 --> 03:23:44,500
and {inauidble, either some already exist in MISP/some are resisting it}.

5643
03:23:44,500 --> 03:23:47,500
Yeah in some cases however you don't really care about having the full set

5645
03:23:47,500 --> 03:23:50,500
and that's where for example specialized formats are really cool

5647
03:23:50,500 --> 03:23:56,500
so whenever we're feeding for example an ids for example we don't care about bitcoin addresses.

5649
03:23:56,500 --> 03:24:03,500
So in those cases STIX and MISP both are very expressive exchange formats

5653
03:24:03,500 --> 03:24:06,500
but whenever you're dealing with feeding tools for example 

5654
03:24:06,500 --> 03:24:10,500
you don't care about about losing, 90% even, of the data set

5655
03:24:10,500 --> 03:24:16,500
as long as you capture those type of data points that your tool can process in the end.

5659
03:24:16,500 --> 03:24:19,500
So this is why generally what we recommend is 

5660
03:24:19,500 --> 03:24:21,500
if you have the option for example to export data from MISP

5663
03:24:21,500 --> 03:24:24,500
is for your IDS for your SIEM and so on and you have the option between 

5665
03:24:24,500 --> 03:24:28,500
for example STIX or Snort or Surikata go with Snort or Surikata

5666
03:24:28,500 --> 03:24:34,500
because those are much more catering to what your tools can actually understand

5670
03:24:34,500 --> 03:24:38,500
Yeah, for example for Yara the same you prefer to have like a

5671
03:24:38,500 --> 03:24:44,500
good Yara rule set that you can run into another anti-virus or your endpoint protection device

5675
03:24:44,500 --> 03:24:48,500
and having a generic one that will not help you to lose the detection.

5677
03:24:52,0 --> 03:24:55,0
Are there any other questions?

5678
03:24:56,0 --> 03:24:59,500
You already took that one that is there that is longer.

5681
03:24:59,500 --> 03:25:02,500
I think we took most of them unless they missed one.

5682
03:25:03,500 --> 03:25:09,500
Yeah, perhaps we should show the deletions because we we didn't actually show it, indeed.

5685
03:25:09,500 --> 03:25:10,500
Yeah, exactly.

5686 
03:25:13,0 --> 03:25:18,500
Okay, oh and now we have some more questions but we can take those after.

5688
03:25:18,500 --> 03:25:23,500
Yeah let's quickly show the deletions so if we go to an event.

5691
03:25:23,500 --> 03:25:25,500
yeah I'll take a hundred events.

5692
03:25:25,500 --> 03:25:29,500
So this is a massive gotcha basically in MISP

5694
03:25:29,500 --> 03:25:33,500
which we have some protective measures in place to avoid this

5695
03:25:33,500 --> 03:25:37,500
but one of the things that you really need to watch out for is

5698
03:25:37,500 --> 03:25:40,500
when you when you add data to MISP and you noticed

5700
03:25:40,500 --> 03:25:45,500
oh crap I should not have added a piece of information that is either confidential information,

5702
03:25:45,500 --> 03:25:48,500
information about the victim that I shouldn't share and so on.

5705
03:25:48,500 --> 03:25:53,500
First delete the attribute, that attribute might still be contained in the event

5707
03:25:53,500 --> 03:25:58,500
in a soft deleted format. You can always toggle and see the deleted attributes within an event

5710
03:25:58,500 --> 03:26:04,500
So I will create an event from scratch as you can see

5712
03:26:04,500 --> 03:26:10,0
Okay so before I move forward on that so we have two protective measures in place

5714
03:26:10,0 --> 03:26:14,500
to avoid accidental information leakage violation.

5715
03:26:14,500 --> 03:26:19,500
One is basically that by default we do not use the soft delete method for 

5717
03:26:19,500 --> 03:26:24,500
anything that was unpublished at first so we're going to show it as an example

5720
03:26:24,500 --> 03:26:27,500
so here's some sensitive information, if Alex were to delete this now 

5723
03:26:27,500 --> 03:26:29,500
this attribute, this would get hard deleted, 

5724
03:26:29,500 --> 03:26:34,500
So this will not create a soft deletion, MISP already tells us 

5725
03:26:34,500 --> 03:26:37,500
are you sure you want to hard delete the attribute? So when you read the text

5728
03:26:37,500 --> 03:26:39,500
you will see the difference there in the wording. 

5729
03:26:39,500 --> 03:26:43,500
The reason for that is the event has not been published yet 

5730
03:26:43,500 --> 03:26:45,500
we know that it has not probably been propagated to other instances.

5734
03:26:45,500 --> 03:26:49,500
There is absolutely no reason to inform anyone that this has been deleted

5736
03:26:49,500 --> 03:26:52,500
so we can immediately just hard delete it.

5738
03:26:52,500 --> 03:26:56,0
So when we do that, it will get hard deleted.

5739
03:26:56,0 --> 03:26:58,500
However, if the event has already been published

5740
03:26:58,500 --> 03:27:01,500
this has already been shared out to other instances potentially.

5742
03:27:01,500 --> 03:27:04,0
So in this case, if we were to delete it, MISP will tell us 

5743
03:27:04,0 --> 03:27:07,500
oh are you sure you want to soft delete this attribute 

5744
03:27:07,500 --> 03:27:09,500
because this is already a published event.

5747
03:27:09,500 --> 03:27:14,0
Now it looks like our event is empty but if you look at the deleted flag 

5748
03:27:14,0 --> 03:27:16,500
you will see that the sensitive attribute is still there

5751
03:27:16,500 --> 03:27:19,500
and if I were to publish the event now, this sensitive attribute 

5753
03:27:19,500 --> 03:27:23,500
would get propagated along with the event.

5754
03:27:23,500 --> 03:27:29,500
If you want to avoid this altogether, there is a way to mangle any attribute that gets self-deleted.

5757
03:27:29,500 --> 03:27:32,500
What happens in that case is a category will be set to Other 

5759
03:27:32,500 --> 03:27:36,500
type will be set to Other and value will be set to Redacted.

5761
03:27:36,500 --> 03:27:40,500
This is a server-wide setting so your administrator or if you are the administrator

5762
03:27:40,500 --> 03:27:43,500
then you yourself can set this setting in the server settings.

5765
03:27:43,500 --> 03:27:48,0
The downside of that is if you are mangling attributes that you're soft deleting

5767
03:27:48,0 --> 03:27:52,0
it will still inform the other instances, they will still remove the data 

5768
03:27:52,0 --> 03:27:54,500
soft delete the data because the uid is reserved.

5771
03:27:54,500 --> 03:27:57,500
However, you cannot recover the attribute anymore.

5772
03:27:57,500 --> 03:28:02,500
So in this case right now we deleted attribute, Alex could now click on the recover button

5776
03:28:02,500 --> 03:28:07,500
and the attribute will be recovered as a normal attribute so if you made a mistake you can recover it.

5779
03:28:07,500 --> 03:28:12,500
So there are two different mindsets, I want to make my data recoverable

5781
03:28:12,500 --> 03:28:15,500
and that I want to always inform others  

5783
03:28:15,500 --> 03:28:19,500
versus I want to always hard delete data that I delete.

5784
03:28:19,500 --> 03:28:25,500
Both of them have a setting so just pick and choose whichever makes sense for your community.

5787
03:28:25,500 --> 03:28:31,500
Whether you prefer secrecy or prefer convenience basically so that's it's basically.

5790
03:28:31,500 --> 03:28:37,0
-Yeah that's delete for attribute so if we delete an event that's another story.
-Yeah

5792
03:28:37,0 --> 03:28:42,500
And this one is interesting because now we have these options where we say

5795
03:28:42,500 --> 03:28:46,500
I want to delete this event and obviously it will be deleted on your instance.

5798
03:28:46,500 --> 03:28:53,500
Nevertheless this even has been already synchronized, copy on different MISP instances

5802
03:28:53,500 --> 03:28:56,500
so that means at the next synchronizations the event should be pulled

5805
03:28:56,500 --> 03:28:59,500
but to avoid such kind of of issue 

5806
03:28:59,500 --> 03:29:04,500
MISP is automatically generating a block list of all those deleted events

5808
03:29:04,500 --> 03:29:09,500
so if you are the administrator you can see at the "Blocklist events",

5810
03:29:09,500 --> 03:29:14,500
you can see the the one that I just deleted. So why we do that?

5812
03:29:14,500 --> 03:29:19,500
It's very simple. We don't want to re-import the event that has been deleted

5814
03:29:19,500 --> 03:29:21,500
because locally we don't want this event.

5816
03:29:21,500 --> 03:29:27,500
So it's a blocklist of all the {inaudible} but there is a catch there.

5818
03:29:27,500 --> 03:29:31,500
Sometimes we have people, oh i'm doing some tests and so on

5820
03:29:31,500 --> 03:29:33,500
I'm synchronizing with MISP but I can't seem to get my event back

5822
03:29:33,500 --> 03:29:36,500
and obviously yes because it's there in this block list.

5824
03:29:36,500 --> 03:29:40,500
So if you have some tests and you're running some tests, don't forget to look at the block list 

5826
03:29:40,500 --> 03:29:46,0
and maybe you want to just remove the event from the blocklist 

5827
03:29:46,0 --> 03:29:48,500
and then you can synchronize back the event.

5830
03:29:48,500 --> 03:29:52,0
there's something to keep in mind it's there, it's done automatically 

5831
03:29:52,0 --> 03:29:56,500
but in some cases you want to manage the blocklist so that's something to keep in mind.

5835
03:29:56,500 --> 03:30:05,500
Yep something else that we perhaps should touch on here is

5838
03:30:05,500 --> 03:30:09,500
for the event deletions besides just a blocklist part

5840
03:30:09,500 --> 03:30:12,0
there is one thing that comes up as a question very often is.

5841
03:30:12,0 --> 03:30:14,500
how do I inform others that an event needs to be removed?

5843
03:30:14,500 --> 03:30:19,500
We don't have a mechanism in place for that so while we can revoke attributes for events

5845
03:30:19,500 --> 03:30:22,500
We don't have that and there's a reason for that.

5847
03:30:22,500 --> 03:30:27,500
In general whenever it comes to events we don't want to give the power 

5848
03:30:27,500 --> 03:30:34,500
to just outright delete events remotely this way so this might change in the future.

5853
03:30:34,500 --> 03:30:39,500
We're having discussions on that whether we want to enable that or not but currently that's not the case.

5855
03:30:39,500 --> 03:30:45,500
Yeah and usually we take as an example emails I mean you can remove emails from your personal mailbox

5858
03:30:45,500 --> 03:30:48,500
but from the remote mailbox if someone already receives the emails

5861
03:30:48,500 --> 03:30:52,500
you want to have the control over third parties on the mailbox 

5862
03:30:52,500 --> 03:30:56,0
that might be one of the drawback I would say.

5864
03:30:56,0 --> 03:31:01,500
So there are two new questions one of them is basically can you demonstrate

5866
03:31:01,500 --> 03:31:06,500
the progressive enrichments of events by the shared communities over time with correlations.

5869
03:31:06,500 --> 03:31:10,500
This one is tough I mean i'm not sure how we could demonstrate that because

5871
03:31:10,500 --> 03:31:15,500
we're not dealing with live instances with live data sets and active sharing

5875
03:31:15,500 --> 03:31:21,500
but perhaps for tomorrow we will prepare an example where we can show it off

5877
03:31:21,500 --> 03:31:28,500
and choose an event that we can show on one of the operational instances

5879
03:31:28,500 --> 03:31:34,500
but I can show one on, you know what I can go on just one second 

5880
03:31:34,500 --> 03:31:42,500
I'm going on an instance. So it was.. oh we are flexible 

5881
03:31:42,500 --> 03:31:49,500
So it's not simple to do it no but so it's maybe something interesting there.
 
5888
03:31:49,500 --> 03:31:56,500
So I'm connecting an instance where I have more expansion services active and so on.

5892
03:31:56,500 --> 03:32:01,500
I'll just keep it for "My Organization Only" so i'm creating an event there

5894
03:32:01,500 --> 03:32:08,500
so what happens on progressively enriching event by shared communities

5896
03:32:08,500 --> 03:32:11,0
I mean it's going back and forth to different communities 
 
5898
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:14,500
but I can imitate what the community is doing usually.

5900
03:32:14,500 --> 03:32:24,500
so if I'm creating an attribute for example I will create a hostname with some network activity.

5903
03:32:24,500 --> 03:32:37,500
So we have specifically a test that we created with this kind of...

5905
03:32:37,500 --> 03:32:41,0
so what would be your community and sharing?

5907
03:32:41,0 --> 03:32:42,500
So it could be for example in the same organization 

5908
03:32:42,500 --> 03:32:47,500
in my case it's just shared to the organization so if I publish event here

5910
03:32:47,500 --> 03:32:53,500
it will be shared with all different instances maybe the different members of CIRCL

5914
03:32:53,500 --> 03:33:01,500
and one of my colleagues is taking one of the indicators there

5916
03:33:01,500 --> 03:33:07,500
and then he's going on the Faresight database doing a full-blown expansion 

5917
03:33:07,500 --> 03:33:09,500
so that means he's basically doing a full-blown expansion.

5921
03:33:09,500 --> 03:33:17,500
What do I have here? I have a a complete set of objects for a specific domain 

5922
03:33:17,500 --> 03:33:24,500
so you see again I'm going to the event graph now I enter my domain name 

5923
03:33:24,500 --> 03:33:27,500
and I have all the passive DNS records associated to that one

5929
03:33:27,500 --> 03:33:32,500
and in this one I think I will have the event timeline 

5930
03:33:32,500 --> 03:33:36,0
I have a completely different timeline of the different expansion and so on.

5932
03:33:36,0 --> 03:33:44,500
So then I will have one of my... it will be published again with the data.

5937
03:33:44,500 --> 03:33:51,0
If it's a collaboration I would say in the same team that's a thing

5939
03:33:51,0 --> 03:33:56,500
so it's sometimes people are working on the same event and publishing it

5942
03:33:56,500 --> 03:34:03,500
Sometimes they are sharing it and doing additional expansion on the things

5945
03:34:03,500 --> 03:34:07,500
until to reach a specific point that is like I would say 

5946
03:34:07,500 --> 03:34:15,500
accessible or at least publishable in a publishing state that is acceptable by various people.

5950
03:34:16,0 --> 03:34:23,500
Now we can make proposal too. So that means if we are again with a different organization, 

5952
03:34:23,500 --> 03:34:28,500
i don't know if in this example it will work but I can take...

5956
03:34:28,500 --> 03:34:31,500
do I have something interesting there

5958
03:34:33,760 --> 03:34:38,500
Yeah, for example I see an interesting IP address, this one.

5960
03:34:38,500 --> 03:34:46,500
So what I could do is i could add.. 

5961
03:34:46,500 --> 03:34:52,500
What's going on here?

5964
03:34:52,500 --> 03:34:57,500
{inaudible}

5965
03:35:04,0 --> 03:35:13,500
Okay just a demo effect, typical. 

5967
03:35:13,500 --> 03:35:22,500
What's going on? Okay, just going back to this one I just want to add a proposal.

5970
03:35:22,500 --> 03:35:27,500
Yes I cannot just...

5971
03:35:27,500 --> 03:35:30,500
you wanted but you're admin.

5972
03:35:30,500 --> 03:35:37,500
You can cheat if you really want, you can do it.

5974
03:35:37,500 --> 03:35:44,0
Yeah, wait, fine. It's just like okay so I don't know for {inaudible} if we answered your question

5977
03:35:44,0 --> 03:35:50,500
but I mean a full-blown step would be like that, if you work on an event it's not a single person obviously.

5980
03:35:50,500 --> 03:35:54,500
When you do an investigation, you do like multiple steps but the question is more like

5984
03:35:54,500 --> 03:35:59,500
if you do it within a team usually you edit the current event in the same organizations

5987
03:35:59,500 --> 03:36:05,500
if you do inter-team, you do proposal, extend it even like we showed before

5988
03:36:05,500 --> 03:36:09,500
and then you start to work on this thing, so it's really depending on the case.

5992
03:36:09,500 --> 03:36:15,0
so I hope you can see what are the capabilities there 

5993
03:36:15,0 --> 03:36:22,500
but it's really the progressive approach of collaboration usually depends on how people are working together.

5994
03:36:22,500 --> 03:36:25,500
If they are really external it's more proposal, extended event.

5999
03:36:25,500 --> 03:36:30,500
If it's within the same team it could be extended event or within the same event,

6001
03:36:30,500 --> 03:36:35,500
that's usually the two way of working. Andras, if you want to add something on that?

6003
03:36:35,500 --> 03:36:43,500
No yeah, that's perfect. Perhaps another question if you're okay with switching.

6007
03:36:43,500 --> 03:36:49,0
Yeah when speaking of feeding tools what would be the automatic way of doing it?

6009
03:36:49,0 --> 03:36:52,500
So normally when we're talking about feeding tools there are two separate ways of doing it

6011
03:36:52,500 --> 03:36:56,500
and we'll go way way deeper into this tomorrow when we talk about integration

6013
03:36:56,500 --> 03:36:58,500
but generally tools can either fetch data from MISP

6014
03:36:58,500 --> 03:37:02,500
so this is a more common way where a tool would use REST search API 

6015
03:37:02,500 --> 03:37:06,0
that we mentioned before where you define your search patterns 

6016
03:37:06,0 --> 03:37:10,500
for example give me everything that is newer than 30 days,

6017
03:37:10,500 --> 03:37:16,500
everything that is not coming from say OSINT sources

6025
03:37:16,500 --> 03:37:21,500
or perhaps not something, nothing that comes related to a certain topic

6027
03:37:21,500 --> 03:37:26,500
for example I'm not interested in Ransomware when feeding my tools, just a stupid example.

6031
03:37:26,500 --> 03:37:28,500
So you set up your filter options 

6032
03:37:28,500 --> 03:37:32,500
and then your tool would fetch data from MISP every 60 minutes, for example.

6035
03:37:32,500 --> 03:37:40,500
and then replace the data set there. You can also do sliding time window searches

6037
03:37:40,500 --> 03:37:43,500
where you say give me everything from the past 60 minutes that is new

6040
03:37:43,760 --> 03:37:50,500
and then you keep concatenating your dataset on the SIEM side, IDS side, whatever tool you're feeding.

6043
03:37:50,500 --> 03:37:53,500
the alternative, if you want to have the data push automatically as it comes in

6046
03:37:53,500 --> 03:37:56,500
you have different channels in MISP that your tools can latch on to.

6048
03:37:56,500 --> 03:38:01,500
The downside being that you still need to do the conversion in those cases.

6050
03:38:01,500 --> 03:38:08,500
So if you were not using the APIs to fetch the data from MISP

6053
03:38:08,500 --> 03:38:12,0
then MISP can push using the MISP JSON format data down 

6054
03:38:12,0 --> 03:38:19,500
via different channels ZeroMQ or the Kafka channel or this blog and so on

6059
03:38:19,500 --> 03:38:25,500
and then your tools automatically feed on that data so you have these two different ways of interacting with it

6062
03:38:25,500 --> 03:38:28,0
There's also a third way where you can basically  

6063
03:38:28,0 --> 03:38:33,500
either build an export module or an enrichment module where an analyst can trigger 

6064
03:38:33,500 --> 03:38:38,500
a direct push of a certain data point to another tool, so that's another option.

6069
03:38:38,500 --> 03:38:44,500
We'll talk about these different strategies when to use which and how to mix those tomorrow more.

6072
03:38:44,500 --> 03:38:50,0
So I hope that answers it in a brief fashion.

6073
03:38:50,0 --> 03:38:57,500
Yeah what i'm showing here is it's just like on the REST search client

6076
03:38:57,500 --> 03:39:01,500
for example you want to feed your Suricata and so on.

6078
03:39:01,500 --> 03:39:15,500
Just take page and a specific limit. So what you can do is 

6079
03:39:15,500 --> 03:39:18,0
if you have a python script and so on you can pull directly the data.

6080
03:39:18,0 --> 03:39:24,500
So the rest client, so you see in this case I have the Suricata rule set 

6081
03:39:24,500 --> 03:39:28,500
but if you want to feed your specific tools and and so on,

6088
03:39:28,500 --> 03:39:36,500
automatically we are generating curl and python card so it could be a bootstrap to see okay,

6090
03:39:36,500 --> 03:39:40,500
how should I create my own tool for feeding my IDS and so on.

6092
03:39:40,500 --> 03:39:45,500
For Suricata, for example a lot of management interface have already MISP connector

6096
03:39:45,500 --> 03:39:52,500
So you can even like feed the data directly from the interface if they have the ability

6100
03:39:52,500 --> 03:39:55,500
Splunk for example, there's a specific application 

6101
03:39:55,500 --> 03:40:01,500
which is an external tools part of the app store of Splunk 

6102
03:40:01,500 --> 03:40:03,500
that you can install for doing the connection

6105
03:40:03,500 --> 03:40:08,500
and some other people are using their own python script to feed other SIEM.

6107
03:40:08,500 --> 03:40:15,500
So again it's a matter of taste if you are curious about the different kind of integrations

6110
03:40:15,500 --> 03:40:22,500
or you can do it in Python for example on PyMISP itself there are plenty of examples.

6113
03:40:22,500 --> 03:40:29,0
So if you go in the example directory of PyMISP

6115
03:40:29,0 --> 03:40:38,500
you have quite significant set of default scripts that you can use 

6116
03:40:38,500 --> 03:40:42,500
and that's I think usually a good basis 

6117
03:40:42,500 --> 03:40:47,500
if you want to start to write your own custom custom tool set for

6118
03:40:47,500 --> 03:40:52,500
feeding your systems or existing software in your infrastructure.

6124
03:40:52,500 --> 03:41:04,500
Yep, I don't know if we should jump on a new topic 

6125
03:41:04,500 --> 03:41:07,500
or we just push the Copalos example for tomorrow?

6128
03:41:07,500 --> 03:41:11,500
yeah I think we can do maybe tomorrow.

6130
03:41:11,500 --> 03:41:16,500
I think that would be stretching it a little bit if we were to start with that

6133
03:41:16,500 --> 03:41:24,500
So quick summary of today, so today we showed how to create an event 

6134
03:41:24,500 --> 03:41:28,500
the basis of MISP like what is an attribute, an object and so on.

6138
03:41:28,500 --> 03:41:35,500
How to create it, how to make proposal, delete and stuff like that, so it's really a simple example.
 
6142
03:41:35,500 --> 03:41:40,500
Tomorrow, we want to show you more the event report aspect

6144
03:41:40,500 --> 03:41:46,500
and automatic imports into into MISP with a practical example of an original report.
 
6147
03:41:46,500 --> 03:41:51,500
and we will discuss tomorrow about how to build sharing communities

6148
03:41:51,500 --> 03:41:55,500
and especially we will share our experience of things that worked

6149
03:41:55,500 --> 03:42:00,0
and things that didn't work in the past years when creating sharing communities.

6153
03:42:00,0 --> 03:42:05,500
So if you are ISAC members or creating your own sharing community even within your organization

6157
03:42:05,500 --> 03:42:09,500
It's something good to participate because we will share with you 

6158
03:42:09,5000 --> 03:42:15,500
some of the things that are interesting of building and bootstrapping such kind of of community.

6163
03:42:15,500 --> 03:42:20,500
I don't know Andras if  you want to add something

6164
03:42:20,500 --> 03:42:26,500
No and that's basically it thanks for everyone for sticking through this

6167
03:42:26,500 --> 03:42:30,500
through it's a very condensed session so we said we didn't make as much progress

6170
03:42:30,500 --> 03:42:33,500
as we hoped so we have quite a bit left for tomorrow

6172
03:42:33,500 --> 03:42:35,500
and hope to see you all here tomorrow.

6173
03:42:35,500 --> 03:42:40,500
Thank you very much, take care and don't hesitate to ask questions

6175
03:42:40,500 --> 03:42:45,0
either later on directly contact us, thank you very much, see you tomorrow.

6177
03:42:45,0 --> 03:42:49,500
Thank you all see you tomorrow
