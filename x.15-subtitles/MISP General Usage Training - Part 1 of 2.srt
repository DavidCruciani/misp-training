1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,719
and I'll pass over the mic all right

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,278
thank you

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,599
yeah great, good morning good afternoon

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:12,719
and even good evening for some of you

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,879
um so um i'm really glad and uh

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,480
we are glad to present about MISP today

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,719
and so it's a

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,240
double series of workshops so we start

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,799
with a workshop of the introduction and

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,799
we go

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,839
more deeper tomorrow in that second

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
workshop

13
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,359
um i'm alexander noah i do work for

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,640
CIRCL and

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,800
i work in the MISP {inaudible}

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,520
so today uh the agenda is the following

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,78
uh we will do a quick introduction to

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,920
MISP

19
00:00:38,79 --> 00:00:43,679
a kind of of one-hour sessions with

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,239
all the detail about MISP and then a

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,359
more like kind of usage deep dive

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:52,558
of one hour where we do hands-on together

23
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:55,519
um for the logistic aspect um

24
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,839
in the chat room we will share with you

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
uh

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,520
all the details how to access the MISP

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,399
instance so during the sessions in the

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,239
workshop

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,840
you can connect to a dedicated MISP

30
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,840
system that we set up for you

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
and this one will be used for all the

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,79
hands-on that we will

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,240
we do as i just mentioned we have a

34
00:01:10,79 --> 00:01:14,158
small short break of 15 minutes

35
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,679
and then we will continue in the end

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960
{inaudible}

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,880
depending of how far we are today uh

38
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,959
we will maybe talk about the community

39
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,719
building aspect but this is a topic for

40
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,239
tomorrow obviously

41
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,640
but if we have some time remaining we

42
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,280
might uh talk about this and then we

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,920
have a

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
q&a sessions uh to discuss about the

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,359
different {inaudible} and so on

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,439
so don't hesitate to to put your

47
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,438
question to zoom

48
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,319
uh directly and we will try to answer live

50
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,600
all those questions that you are asking  

51
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,599
during uh during this session

52
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,239
so first of all welcome all as well from

53
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,519
me so i'm Andras Iklody i'm

54
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:56,798
also working at CIRCL working on MISP

55
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,280
um to just kick things off um i think

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,719
it's a good

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,79
good moment to start a little bit about

58
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,78
the history of how this whole thing

59
00:02:00,78 --> 00:02:04,879
started how MISP came about

60
00:02:02,78 --> 00:02:06,839
so just a quick introduction of where we

61
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,519
came from and where where we are

62
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,399
nowadays uh initially this whole thing

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,520
for us with MISP

64
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,959
started as part of a of a series of

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,360
incidents that we had in

66
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,759
back in 2012 between national and

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,480
military CSIRTS at the time

68
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,799
where we were basically investigating umattacks

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
that were hitting several of the

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
institutions at the at the time

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
and one of the interesting things that

73
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,759
we found was that even though we had

74
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
something called the malware analysis

75
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,120
working group which was this which is a

76
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,360
group that was regularly meeting and

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,680
discussing ongoing incidents

78
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,720
we still had a massive gap in between

79
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,80
those meetings

80
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,318
where everyone was working in their own

81
00:02:42,80 --> 00:02:45,920
silo on basically the same attack and

82
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,759
and doing reverse engineering of the

83
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,0
165.92 --> 170
same attacks without

84
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,439
having the ways, the means or the processes

86
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,39
to directly share with our peers so we

87
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,919
ended up with a lot of duplication of

88
00:02:55,39 --> 00:02:57,759
work which ended

89
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,199
which was obviously frustrating from uh

90
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,439
for many of us

91
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,598
so Christophe Vandeplas at the time he

92
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,318
was working at the belgian

93
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,399  
ministry of defense um in his free time

94
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,318
wrote a platform called {inaudible}

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,519
that later on ended up becoming MISP so

96
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,280
the initial idea was

97
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,800
really for reverse engineers to share

98
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,439
the output of their work directly with

99
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,719
their peers

100
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:22,158
in a hosted platform and since then

101
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,158
obviously MISP has evolved and changed

102
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,840
the scope of what we were nowadays doing

103
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,798
with MISP and what sort of information

104
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,640
we're sharing

105
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
but it all started with this and since

106
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,878
then it has been an ongoing effort

107
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,199
basically by

108
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,199
a large community of different

109
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,359
requirements and different needs

110
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,359
and that has been building both the

111
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,159
ideas that go into MISP as well as the

112
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
software itself

113
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,839
next slide please

114
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,919
yeah so what is the background and why

115
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,839
we are doing

116
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,79
MISP it uh i think like Andras

117
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
mentioned it started from a with a kind

118
00:03:56,80 --> 00:03:59,40
of

119
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,479
{inaudible} project for a small set of

120
00:03:59,39 --> 00:04:03,598
CIRCL

121
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,959
CIRCL is nowadays

122
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,359
the CERT for the private sector, the

123
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,959
community {inaudible} in luxembourg

124
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,200
and we basically deal with the

125
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,158
development of MISP not only for our use

126
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,359
case but for many

127
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:18,319
different users so we are called as

128
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,439
a CERT we basically operate the

129
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,478
development and we operate

130
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,478
{inaudible} communities

131
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,960
so a little bit about our involvement

132
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,478
and

133
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,79
why we're doing this in the first place

134
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,560
so we as CIRCL we're funded by the

135
00:04:30,79 --> 00:04:35,680
Ministry of Economy to basically build

136
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,600
security for the private sector uh and a

137
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,199
lot of what we do involves uh open

138
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
source software development so we're

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,160
basically

140
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,79
the funding that we get for the uh for

141
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,199
activities also cover our development

142
00:04:44,79 --> 00:04:47,918
focus

143
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,360
we're also uh besides just building the

144
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,159
tools like {inaudible} mentioned we're

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,479
also

146
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,919
basically involved in a lot of sharing

147
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,839
activities as well as our day-to-day

148
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,399
operations we're users of the

149
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,478
tool primarily as well we basically host

150
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,719
a bunch of different communities for the

151
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,439
uh national C-Certs for the

152
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,919
luxembourgish private sector community

153
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,680
for law enforcement uh organizations

154
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,959
financial institutions and so on and so

155
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,319
forth

156
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,239
so so we're kind of uh

157
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,240
in the game on both sides so to say that

158
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,120
both as a

159
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,0
318.24 --> 322
producer and as a consumer, also and the

160
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,79
project was

161
00:05:22,0 --> 00:05:25,759
322 --> 325.759
co-financed by the European Union

162
00:05:24,79 --> 00:05:29,120
under the CEF project

163
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,400
uh so this is also one of the sources of

164
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
the income that we got basically to

165
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,560
build the tool and as a FIRST member you

166
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,79
have access to a MISP instance that is

167
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,478
operated and

168
00:05:36,79 --> 00:05:40,0
336.08 --> 340
co-maintained by FIRST and CIRCL that

169
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,680
you can get access to

170
00:05:40,0 --> 00:05:43,519
340 --> 343.52
so you just need to to use your

171
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,680
traditional credential or

172
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,359
access at first and you get access to

173
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,600
this instance with information

174
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,439
that you can use and so on we will talk

175
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,160
about that later on

176
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,600
so the main question and i think it's

177
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,80
coming from this story uh

178
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
as Andras mentioned from the early days

179
00:05:58,79 --> 00:06:01,758
MISP was

180
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,840
focusing from a very specific aspect

181
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,120
which was malware reversing and so on

182
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,799
nowadays it's a threat intelligence sharing platforms we

183
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,38
are basically sharing any kind of

184
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,38
intelligence through uh through MISP

185
00:06:11,38 --> 00:06:14,478
um because we had an evolution of the

186
00:06:13,38 --> 00:06:16,399
time for the different things so

187
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,879
and our main goals and that's very

188
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,439
important for us it's an open source

189
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,120
software so that means MISP will always

190
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,519
remain an open source project we even

191
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,0
383.12 --> 386
take

192
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,879
some decisions within the project to

193
00:06:26,0 --> 00:06:29,120
386 --> 389.12
keep it as

194
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,639
open source and that's that's really a

195
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,720
key for us so it's really uh

196
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,800
something that you can download yourself

197
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,39
run on your infrastructure and so on

198
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
you can really have the full control on

199
00:06:37,38 --> 00:06:40,639
the software stack

200
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,0
398.24 --> 402
when you are using MISP and one of the

201
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,38
goals of the software itself is to

202
00:06:42,0 --> 00:06:46,240
402 --> 406.24
collect information

203
00:06:43,38 --> 00:06:48,159
from other partners, from in the {inaudible}

204
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
from automatic tools from different

205
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,800
fields and so on

206
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,198
that was really one of the initial goal

207
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,680
of MISP is like being able to collect

208
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,360
to get all this information into

209
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,38
one place

210
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,560
and then afterwards what you can do with

211
00:06:59,38 --> 00:07:02,719
it is to normalize

212
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,839
correlate this information, extend the

213
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,560
information and enrich

214
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,879
information with more information and then

216
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,800
really benefit from the sharing aspect

217
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,120
of MISP and you can allow

218
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,840
teams and community to collaborate

219
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,478
and we have

220
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,318
seen MISP for example use not only

221
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,159
within different organizations but even

222
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,759
within a single organization you can, for

223
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
example run multiple MISP

224
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,120
to collaborate directly on different

225
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,79
investigations

226
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,519
incidents and cases and obviously when

227
00:07:28,79 --> 00:07:31,279
you have all this information and all

228
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,758
these analytic platform into MISP

229
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,638
you are ready to use this information to

230
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,960
for example

231
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,840
feed your automatic protective tools

232
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,0
456.96 --> 462
like intrusion detection systems,

233
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,279
firewalls whatever and to feed

234
00:07:42,0 --> 00:07:45,598
462 --> 465.599
automatically those

235
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,799
information to basically make protective

236
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,319
measures

237
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,319
in your environment

238
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,840
so, start from the starting point that we

239
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,680
already mentioned basically how we

240
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,638
started out with MISP

241
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,800
let's have a quick look at how uh the

242
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,400
user base of MISP evolved in terms of

243
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,0
482.8 --> 486
the different types of stakeholders

244
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,560
within our own organizations and other organizations

246
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,319
the reason for that is obviously that

247
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,560
this drives the development process as well

249
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,400
so the way MISP grows over time really

250
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
depends on the type of users that are using

252
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:18,319
the type of users that are requesting new

253
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,159
features or that are providing pull

254
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,639
requests on the project and providing code

256
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,759
for the project so i said before

257
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,160
initially

258
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,759
the scope of MISP was very limited it

259
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,360
was basically just the output of malware

260
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,199
reversers which meant

261
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,479
raw indicators that we were extracting

262
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,560
during the process and that we're

263
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,639
sharing directly

264
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,79
with our partners, this meant very little

265
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,519
analysis was done on each of these

266
00:08:38,80 --> 00:08:41,599
individual indicators there was very

267
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,440
little information in terms of

268
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,200
of why those data points are relevant in

269
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,360
the long term how they are meant to be used

271
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,519
from detection perspective they were

272
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,480
really just the raw output

273
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,0
529.519 --> 534
from the analysis process or the

274
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,80
reversing process

275
00:08:54,0 --> 00:08:57,519
534 --> 537.519
now one of the side effects of this when

276
00:08:56,80 --> 00:08:59,440
you start building a collection within

277
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,360
your organization of this information

278
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,880
the security analysts are feeding your

279
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,320
various protective tools become

280
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,838
interested in that data set

281
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,0
544.32 --> 548
because obviously whatever is targeting

282
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,160
your organization or your direct peers

283
00:09:08,0 --> 00:09:11,360
548 --> 551.36
are probably the most relevant piece of

284
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,39
information that you can use for

285
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,159
detection

286
00:09:13,39 --> 00:09:19,39
so one of the first steps that we opened

288
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,479
up to was basically involving our own

289
00:09:19,39 --> 00:09:23,278
security analyst with our

290
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,320
own organizations so they can hook

291
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,360
the output of

292
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,80
of the reverse engineering team

293
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,360
up to their SIEMs to their IDSs to

294
00:09:30,80 --> 00:09:33,360
their firewalls

295
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,440
and to feed this data directly into

296
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,720
their protective measures

297
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,720
now one of the interesting things when

298
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,800
you start doing that though is that you

299
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,560
generate a new type of output which is

300
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,559
timeliness for the data, freshness for

301
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,838
the data as well as feedback on how

302
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,838
useful the data was

303
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,240
so we're very often when you're

304
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,40
extracting information

305
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,360
by sandboxing for example a lot of the

306
00:09:53,39 --> 00:09:57,679
data generated will be noise in the end

307
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,759
and this noise will generate false

308
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,159
positive alerts for example

309
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,319
in your detection tools. Now feeding this

310
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,559
information back

311
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,559
to data gave it a whole new type of value

313
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,159
we had freshness so if an older

314
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,159
indicator was reused

315
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,439
over time we saw that that is still

316
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,160
something that is actively to be monitored

318
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,838
and if we saw that something turned out

319
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,199
to be a cleaned up host

320
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,440
in the meanwhile or something was a

321
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
false positive from the get-go

322
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,399
we could feed that information back as well

324
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,759
so suddenly once you have timeliness as

325
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,759
well as the the raw data itself

326
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,278
you get the intelligence analyst

327
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,399
interested that are tracking the

328
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:42,0
movements and the changes of how attackers operate

330
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,639
uh over time so that means that usually

332
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,199
back then especially in 2012 in most of our

333
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,560
organizations the people that are doing

334
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,560
intelligence and the people that were

335
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,239
doing operations and security for the

336
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,680
operations were usually working in their own silos

338
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,40
so while there was obviously interaction

339
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,958
between the teams, it was not as

340
00:10:57,39 --> 00:11:01,919
ingrained to work together

341
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,599
between those type of roles but this

342
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,0
661.92 --> 664
changed over time and one of the changes

344
00:11:04,0 --> 00:11:08,78
664 --> 668.079
that we saw happened was that the output

345
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
of what the security analysts

346
00:11:08,78 --> 00:11:12,159
and the reversers and the analysts were

347
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,480
outputting basically from the operation side

349
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,399
became more and more interesting for the

350
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,839
intelligence analysts that meant that

351
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,919
if they were tracking a certain threat

352
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,600
actor and they could attribute certain

353
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,439
actions that they were seen in the

354
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,519
network of the organization

355
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,959
to the certain threat actor they could

356
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,278
monitor for example how

357
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,879
the given actor was changing how fast

358
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,78
they were changing infrastructure

359
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,0
690.88 --> 694
whether they were switching up their

360
00:11:32,78 --> 00:11:36,78
methodology and this

361
00:11:34,0 --> 00:11:37,519
694 --> 697.519
gave them a lot of idea of useful data

362
00:11:36,78 --> 00:11:39,199
of improving their libraries of the

363
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,799
threat actors that they were tracking

364
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,920
so suddenly we got this group interests

365
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,838
as well and they were obviously

366
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,879
producing data as well so nowadays if

367
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,279
you look at MISP

368
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,200
going from a raw indicator sharing platform

369
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,399
that MISP was initially

370
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,160
nowadays you have a lot of the high

371
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,759
level threat intel information included

372
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,720
with the data as well so you will see threat reports

374
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,720
you will see interconnected information

375
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:04,399
about threat actors modus operandi

377
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,79
infrastructure impact and so on so forth

378
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,360
these extra layers of information that

379
00:12:06,78 --> 00:12:08,719
we were missing initially

380
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,0
727.36 --> 730
so this was the biggest change that we

381
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,440
had over time within our own

382
00:12:10,0 --> 00:12:13,919
730 --> 733.92
organizations but

383
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,519
obviously as a CSIRT that has

384
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,199
different constituencies

385
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,799
we're also interacting with the security

386
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
teams of other organizations and one of

387
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,319
the things we noticed early on was

388
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,160
there's a lot of the issues that other

389
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
types of organizations had internally

390
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,800
with information sharing are very similar to ours

392
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,958
so initially the first use case that we

393
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,799
got that was different and from our

394
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,719
normal security use case

395
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,399
was basically the various financial

396
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,920
organizations reaching out to us saying

397
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,759
that their fraud teams were

398
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,599
running into similar sort of issues with

399
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,759
sharing between their teams,

400
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,839
sharing with other partner teams,

401
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,319
information about mule accounts and

402
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,519
about other fraud related information

403
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,680
so they reached out to us and

404
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,480
basically their security teams reached

405
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,199
out to us and said

406
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,639
can't we just try to help them also

407
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,0
777.2 --> 780
to share that sort of information

408
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,759
through MISP directly, I mean we already

409
00:13:00,0 --> 00:13:03,200
780 --> 783.2
had the tooling in place

410
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,200
it was just a question of changing the data model

412
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,639
so we we started doing that for uh together

413
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,480
with the financial sector initially

414
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,0
788.639 --> 792
where we expanded the data model of MISP

415
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,519
when we allowed for modeling of new

416
00:13:12,0 --> 00:13:15,919
792 --> 795.92
custom data types

417
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,679
and it's even surprising to us at the

418
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,319
time turned into a success

419
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,599
very rapidly so nowadays we're involved

420
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,959
with quite a few different types of

421
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,519
organizations out there

422
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,879
replicating the same scenario where for

423
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,320
example law enforcement, where we initially had

425
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,79
mostly contact with their security teams

426
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,240
and helping them build data sets for bootstrapping their forensic

429
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,480
investigations nowadays we have all

430
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,959
sorts of information sharing involving

431
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,278
uh for example uh seized goods information sharing from

433
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,799
border control agencies uh law enforcement agencies

435
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,120
sharing information about passenger information

436
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,359
so a lot of the type of data

437
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,360
sharing that was very unusual for us as

438
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,79
a CSIRT initially

439
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,879
now once you get all this data in a

440
00:13:58,78 --> 00:14:01,39
system and you

441
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,399
started building a data set from your community

443
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,79
you start to see trends in the data set

444
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,839
and this is what gets

445
00:14:06,78 --> 00:14:09,759
for example our risk analysis team

446
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
interested in it the moment that you're

447
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,639
seeing how attackers are changing their

448
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,199
trends over time

449
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,719
you can better advise your constituency your customers and so on

451
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,160
about the different risks that they might be facing and the

453
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,879
different risks that they should be preparing for

455
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,958
and preparing the organizations for

456
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,519
based on what the same sector is facing

457
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,359
perhaps in the same geographic location

458
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,120
so suddenly you get a lot of knowledge

459
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,120
out of the collected data as long as

460
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
data is well contextualized and i think

461
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,78
this will be one of the main topics that

462
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,519
we're going to be talking about quite a bit today and tomorrow

464
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,599
is contextualizing the information and

465
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,600
making the information actually usable

466
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
and turning data really into knowledge

467
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,40
yeah so like Andras mentioned

468
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
we have a pretty large set of different

469
00:14:55,39 --> 00:15:00,0
895.04 --> 900
communities using MISP

470
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,159
and over the time it became i think more

471
00:15:00,0 --> 00:15:03,759
900 --> 903.76
complicated to handle all those requests

472
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,120
from different organizations

473
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:10,0
903.76 --> 910
um so we came with a model of governance

474
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,240
even if it's a very lightweight one we

475
00:15:10,0 --> 00:15:13,839
910 --> 913.839
decided to have this kind of models to

476
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
still benefit from the open source

477
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,199
community model and then

478
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,278
bring all the experience from a

479
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,198
different community into systems where

480
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,720
it allows us to develop and extend the

481
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,958
software so we decided to

482
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,240
create this kind of models where we

483
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,879
basically

484
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,320
take care of all the features and

485
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,679
requests that we receive from different organizations

487
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,599
so we use this kind of priority list of different features

489
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,720
and we get that feedback from {inaudible}

491
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,879
one of the {inaudible} one i would say is

492
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,480
Github so we get the feed from

493
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,399
the different issue that we receive from

494
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,639
Github i mean on the if you look at on

495
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,320
Github you'll see that we have a

496
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,320
significant number of issues and those

497
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,800
issue are usually for us a way to track down

499
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,879
all the different requests of features

500
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,120
in MISP and that's one way to get it.

501
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,639
Another way and this one is a quite a common one

503
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,39
is basically a training or session like

504
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,799
this where people are providing feedback,

505
00:16:05,39 --> 00:16:09,39
bug reports, future requests and so on

506
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,879
directly during the training and for us

507
00:16:09,39 --> 00:16:12,958
uh i think really practical and we can

508
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,39
get all this information needed for us

509
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,0
972.959 --> 976
to improve the software. Another thing

510
00:16:15,39 --> 00:16:17,759
that we do and

511
00:16:16,0 --> 00:16:19,839
976 --> 979.839
that's maybe for the audience some

512
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,39
people are interested in that one

513
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,560
we know that there are plenty of

514
00:16:21,39 --> 00:16:24,399
different MISP of groups that we don't

515
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:28,319
control and that we don't manage that's

516
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,679
great we have for example ISACs, ISAO

517
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,360
doing really those kind of things where

518
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,838
you have those kind of user groups

519
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,600
and what we do we participate on a

520
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,279
regular basis to one of those groups for

521
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,0
995.6 --> 998
example on a quarterly basis on a yearly basis

523
00:16:38,0 --> 00:16:41,759
998 --> 1001.759
and we do a collection of requirements

524
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,240
from those different groups

525
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,720
during one session and that's really

527
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,799
i think useful for us because it's a way

528
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
to to gather information so for example

529
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,78
Andras mentioned those

530
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,519
financial groups where people are

531
00:16:52,78 --> 00:16:54,559
sharing information about bank account

532
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,480
detail and so on

533
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,919
and that's where we basically gather all

534
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,278
those requirements

535
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,39
so if you are setting up a group

536
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,278
somewhere in US or

537
00:17:01,39 --> 00:17:04,318
in the world about sharing information

538
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,0
1023.279 --> 1026
and so on and you want to

539
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,759
invite us at some point in time it's a

540
00:17:06,0 --> 00:17:12,160
1026 --> 1028.959
way for us to gather those kind of requirements

542
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,759
we do a summit which is a yearly event

543
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
usually it was physical but nowadays

544
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,0
1033.76 --> 1038
it's virtual trainings

545
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,918
so it's basically every user or

546
00:17:18,0 --> 00:17:21,199
1038 --> 1041.199
organizations using MISP presenting what

547
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,959
they are doing

548
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,558
it's a way for us to to see the

549
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,480
interactions and see what

550
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,480
can be improved in MISP and see {inaudible}

551
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,759
in the community behind

552
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,839
and then we have a kind of 20%

553
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,200
project around in MISP

554
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:38,558
1051.84 --> 1056
where we design new functionalities and we test

556
00:17:36,0 --> 00:17:39,919
1056 --> 1059.919
them out for example one of those is the

557
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,200
detailing of indicators

558
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,400
which was a request from different

559
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,919
organizations but it was kind of

560
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,919
difficult to design

561
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,240
and with this kind of models where we

562
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,480
designed first as a kind of prototype

563
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,558
multiple iterations uh we did a multiple

564
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,0
1070.48 --> 1076
research paper on that and then finally

565
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,918
this become part of the MISP core software

566
00:17:56,0 --> 00:17:59,679
1076 --> 1079.679
we will show that later on but so we

567
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,679
have a lightweight governance model

568
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,840
but really the goal is to gather as

569
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,280
much feedback from the user so don't

570
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,599
hesitate if you have any bug reports, ideas and so on

571
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,319
either open an issue,

573
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,918
get in touch with us.

575
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,400
You are more than welcome to basically

576
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,399
share such kind of information.

577
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,719
Yeah, now addressing the elephant in the room

579
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,160
when you bring so many different

580
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,759
organizations together and build a large

581
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,200
community of sharing with different

582
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,558
needs and requirements

583
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
you're obviously going to have to run

584
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,720
into conflicting requirements as well

585
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,240
so one of the most obvious ones that

586
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,640
that we're dealing with very often with

587
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,720
information sharing and something that

588
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,840
that we're working on tackling ,

590
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:43,599
basically since we started with MISP, is dealing

591
00:18:42,79 --> 00:18:45,279
with a different requirement of

592
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,879
of what you count as valuable

593
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,519
information depending on your use case

594
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,599
so this is different also within 

596
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,360
different analysts, different roles

597
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,79
within the same organization as

598
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:58,720
well so for example, for us as a CSIRT in general

600
00:18:57,38 --> 00:19:00,240
uh detection is the most important

601
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,640
matter so we're interested

602
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:08,880
in in using indicators to detect if our constituency

604
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,0
1146.88 --> 1150
is affected by something that the

605
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,880
information is being

606
00:19:10,0 --> 00:19:14,160
1150 --> 1154.16
shared about or whether uh any of the

607
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,200
the infrastructure that we're

608
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,840
responsible for is infected 

609
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,639
on the other hand if you're talking to an isp

611
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,640
one of the large

612
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
requirements from an isp basically will

613
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,38
be able to protect their users

614
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,79
from potential harm so that means that

616
00:19:30,79 --> 00:19:34,480
if there are any urls, websites, and so on

618
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,480
that they should block for their users they

619
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,679
need to be able to generate a block list

620
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,440
out of the data

621
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,600
that is considered to be malicious

622
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,360
enough now if you compare these two use cases

623
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,240
with each other detection versus blocking

625
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,359
you will immediately see that the effect

627
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,359
of having a false positive in the data

628
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,160
set or data that is no longer fresh

629
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,119
has a completely different impact 

630
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,960
sure for us when

631
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,719
that are mostly in the detection game

632
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,400
it's annoying we get a false positive

633
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,400
alert it has to be handled

634
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,759
and it takes time and effort it also

635
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,200
introduces something called alert fatigue

636
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,319
that i'm sure many of you are familiar with

638
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,79
if you're getting a lot of false

639
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,120
positive alerts you're more likely to ignore the

641
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,798
next alert that you get but besides that

642
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,879
it has no real operational impact on us 

644
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,879
on the other hand for an isp that ends up blocking

645
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,880
something that is uh

646
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,400
potentially a false positive might have a catastrophic impact

648
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,600
imagine if someone accidentally, for example shares

650
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:35,759
facebook.com as an indicator that might

651
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:39,119
basically cause a riot with their users or it might {inaudible}

653
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,519
but it's a different story

654
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,479
but with that in mind, you see that these

655
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:47,679
two use cases are already conflicting

656
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,360
now if you also take the perspective of

657
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,400
intelligence analysts that are tracking

658
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,798
threat actor movements in to account 

660
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,400
that's an even more lax use case 

662
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,159
where you care about whether something is a fresh indicator still or not

664
00:21:00,79 --> 00:21:03,439
even less than the other two groups.

665
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,880
The reason for that is you're interested in

666
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,120
the historical movements of a threat actor, for example.

668
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,439
So even if something is no longer

669
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,38
an indicator because and an infected

670
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,960
website was cleaned up

671
00:21:13,38 --> 00:21:17,38
since the time when the indicator was

672
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,880
shared they still want to see

673
00:21:17,38 --> 00:21:20,558
how long, for example a threat actor was

674
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,80
using that infrastructure,

675
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,119
how quickly they changed to something

676
00:21:22,79 --> 00:21:27,519
else and what methods they used

677
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,239
back when they were exploiting it. 

679
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,839
So if you bring these different requirements on board on

680
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,959
the same platform is difficult and there are some

682
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,960
things that we can do to alleviate these

683
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,720
issues. For example what we do with

684
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,798
MISP

685
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,480
we have a system called warning list

686
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,480
system that allows us to filter out

687
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,640
obvious false positives

688
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:54,798
so we maintain these lists of

689
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,720
most common websites, empty hash lists,

690
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,319
public dns resolvers and all these

691
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,558
typical things that end up in

692
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:04,399
the sets while doing automatic extraction for example

694
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,80
that end up being false positives but

695
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,720
with that said this is just one part of the story

697
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,79
So if you're looking at the different

698
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,880
use cases up there that doesn't solve our issue

700
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,600
of having different requirements

701
00:22:14,0 --> 00:22:17,558
1334 --> 1336.559
from the data set based on what you do with it

703
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,319
and this is where contextualization

704
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,158
becomes more important again

705
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,0
1340.32 --> 1344
if we can supply the information together with the data,

707
00:22:23,0 --> 00:22:26,880
1344 --> 1346.88
why this data is relevant and what context you're

708
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,640
supposed to be using it

709
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,480
then the consumers of the data can make

710
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,440
those decisions for themselves based on

711
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,279
whatever they want to use

712
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,640
the data for in any of those different use cases

714
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,720
so one of our main efforts with MISP has been

716
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,0
1360.72 --> 1364
to be able to provide these different

717
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,519
structures together with the data and to

718
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:48,519
1364 --> 1367.52
be able to label data well enough. Back to you. 

720
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,720
Yeah so and that's iI think important regarding the

721
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,720
different kind of use cases and so on

722
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,360
and we try to support those different use cases and

725
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,679
that's sometimes challenging for us but luckily

726
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,320
we are at the same time

727
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,840
part of various community so we can see

728
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,279
the different use cases, especially

729
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:13,480
regarding the handling of false positive which is

731
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,558
an ongoing challenge but we will show

732
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,840
you how to handle that

733
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,0
1396.559 --> 1400
and at the same time we basically

734
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,79
operate those different communities.

735
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:24,159
1400 --> 1404.159
So for example we operate a pretty large

736
00:23:22,79 --> 00:23:26,798
one for the private sector

737
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,559
where we have a lot of organizations,

739
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,158
more than 1200 organizations are basically connected there.

740
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,440
It's pretty large and we see an active

742
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,400
community sharing information and

743
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,400
there is plenty of different communities

744
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,840
some that we don't know even about

745
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,278
because you can even run your own

746
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,558
private communities without telling anyone, that's fine.


748
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,759
That's part of the system but if you want to have different kind of communities

750
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:55,839
you can connect those automatically then you have I would say

753
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,798
different kind of model you have those kind of

755
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,480
fully island mode communities. 

756
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,679
Those kind of trusted groups so for example for the 

758
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:05,519
intelligence community it's very common for them to run MISP

759
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:09,759
in an island mode so having air gap system and so on

761
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,919
sometimes they are partially connected

762
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:13,599
with third parties to share partial

763
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,400
information so for example we know some organizations

765
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,640
or for example border controls or customs

767
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,919
are using MISP but they still need to

768
00:24:20,79 --> 00:24:24,319
share some small information and that

770
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,158
partially connected system. 

771
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:28,0
1464.32 --> 1468
MISP freely supports those kind of models

772
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,679
and then you have community that are

773
00:24:28,0 --> 00:24:31,359
1468 --> 1471.36
more broad and more large

774
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,278
for example in the financial sector and

775
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,240
I think the CSIRT Luxembourg has some banks

777
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,599
we are involved in various sharing communities

779
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,519
at European level and worldwide level

780
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,759
where for example we know some ISACs that are dedicated to

782
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,200
the financial sector are using it as a sharing mechanism 

784
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,278
you have some organizations that are really

785
00:24:49,38 --> 00:24:52,480
dedicated to a payment processing system

786
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,519
that are using this to share automatically

788
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,519
information and so on or analysis

790
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,519
One of the i would say pretty large community too is

791
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,960
with the military organization and international organizations

793
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,720
FIRST for example, you have a lot of FIRST members using

794
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,639
MISP for sharing their information

796
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,759
but there are plenty of networks, national governmental networks

798
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,278
a military one intelligence, one or even NATO for example are using

800
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,599
using MISP so maybe some of you are eligible to access those ones

802
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,399
so we have on the MISP an interface a way to connect to those

804
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,240
community and you can reach out to the

805
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,200
different community by asking for access for example

807
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,319
then you have very specific communities

808
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,720
that are set up by security vendors it's not uncommon

810
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,759
tp see for example a security vendor

811
00:25:34,0 --> 00:25:37,359
1534 --> 1537.36
services their own MISP

812
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,119
we have seen for example some

813
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,319
{inaudible} agents vendors running a dedicated MISP

815
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,480
or even some operators of specific cloud

816
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,400
services running a MISP instance

817
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,360
to share information amongst

818
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,320
their different customers.

819
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,798
Then you have communities that are

820
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:55,38
i would say very specific on the topic

821
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:59,79
for example you have about sick information uh false news

823
00:25:58,79 --> 00:26:02,278
and stuff like that you have communities doing that

825
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,720
for example we cooperate one called the COVID-19 MISP

827
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,839
which is really targeting COVID-19 as a topic 

828
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,720
and then you have 10 different subtopics like 

829
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,399
cyber security, health related topics and so on.

831
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,679
So you can see that MISP can be really used on

832
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,440
different model of communities

833
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,440
you can bridge those communities,

834
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,360
you can interconnect those with together,

835
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,759
you can keep it for yourself, so it's

836
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,839
really a matter of models.

837
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,759
Worldwide there are I would say a lot of

838
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:31,199
communities that we are not aware of

839
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,599
but we as CIRCL operates

840
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,120
around 20 communities nowadays, that you

841
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,839
can basically get access

842
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,839
and Andras just sharing in the chat the

843
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:42,439
access to the COVID-19 MISP and if you want to get access to

845
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,320
that one you can connect on the main page and self-register and

847
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,519
you can request access to that community 

849
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,38
so you see that MISP has different groups different communities

851
00:26:53,38 --> 00:26:56,640
and it's up to you at the end to decide

852
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,879
which kind of community you want to {inaudiable either be/visit}

854
00:27:01,38 --> 00:27:04,798
So, a little bit besides all the technical things

856
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:06,839
that we talked about, that we do with MISP,

857
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,919
and that we try to solve with it.

858
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,278
In terms of sharing, there are obviously

859
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,720
going to be other hurdles that you have

860
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,159
to overcome whenever it comes to information sharing

862
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,679
one of the the toughest things to

863
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:18,880
1636 --> 1638.88
overcome and this is where no tool can really help you

865
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,679
is to get enough trust in a community to

866
00:27:22,79 --> 00:27:24,319
be able to share your information with them

868
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,918
So the only way to facilitate this is really social interactions

870
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,0
1647.919 --> 1652
so sadly though we're living in times

871
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,278
where social interactions are tougher than usual

873
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,440
but for example events like FIRST conferences

874
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,880
 are great ways to get to know your community and to

876
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,200
build this trust and build those

877
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,159
social relationships that you need 

879
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,679
to be able to really exchange meaningful

880
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,918
information with the community

881
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,0
1667.679 --> 1672
so i really encourage everyone that

882
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,360
wants to partake in information sharing communities

884
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,278
to be social, to reach out, and to get to know your community

886
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,79
because that's the biggest facilitator for sharing in the first place.

888
00:28:00,79 --> 00:28:03,599
Other than that, there are obviously some

889
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,360
legal restrictions that you have

890
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,398
that might come up in the entire process.

891
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,79
We see this very often with organizations where the first

893
00:28:08,79 --> 00:28:10,918
questions that they ask us when they join

895
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,240
in our communities okay how does this

896
00:28:13,38 --> 00:28:18,558
fit into GDPR for example.

897
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,38
If my legal team asks me why I am sharing

898
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,720
an information out what can i

899
00:28:21,38 --> 00:28:24,798
give them as an explanation of why i'm

900
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,159
supposed to or allowed to do this.

901
00:28:25,198 --> 00:28:28,319
So if you need any help with that we

902
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,840
have a bunch of compliance documentation

903
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,240
and that we've been working on together with a bunch of partners

905
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,798
and so we have descriptions for how

906
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,919
MISP fits into the GDPR, the NIS directive

908
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,360
and some other frameworks so just

909
00:28:40,79 --> 00:28:43,119
have a look there and if you have any

910
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,0
1721.36 --> 1724
questions or if you feel that anything is not covered

912
00:28:44,0 --> 00:28:47,599
1724 --> 1727.6
let us know and we keep updating our documentation

914
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,519
based on on feedback of what's missing

915
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,559
or ideas that we should be incorporating in there

917
00:28:52,558 --> 00:29:00,640
but generally , once your legal team is more

919
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,360
familiar with the process and why this

920
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,80
is {inaudiable done/tied}

921
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,759
why ensuring security for your

922
00:29:04,79 --> 00:29:06,798
organization and for the data that you

923
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,960
have to secure is important then it's seen more as a

925
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,360
benefit than a hurdle really

926
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,278
but it obviously takes time to get

927
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,240
this into your processes to define why you're

929
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,679
doing what you're doing

930
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,199
your retention periods,

931
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,960
describing how you're going to handle data and so on

933
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,399
so this obviously has some ramp up time

935
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,439
but we have a lot of documentation that will help you with that. 

937
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,558
There are also some practical restrictions that we hear from

938
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,79
organizations so very often when

939
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,440
organizations reach out to us

940
00:29:34,79 --> 00:29:37,199
the first thing they say is we don't

941
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,120
really have any information to share,

942
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,880
we don't have the capability for example

943
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,639
to build those highly vetted threat reports that we're so used to

945
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,960
from feed providers and obviously very few organizations do.

947
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,200
With that said information sharing comes

948
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,600
in many different shapes and sizes for example going back

950
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,558
to the initial use case about

951
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,0
1795.2 --> 1800
providing feedback from your analysts

952
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,240
about the data that you receive from

953
00:30:00,0 --> 00:30:03,839
1800 --> 1803.84
your community is already valuable

954
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,599
information sharing so if someone for

955
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,278
example provides sightings

956
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,839
I've also seen this indicator at this given time

958
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,359
that can already help you tune the data set

960
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,879
for what goes into your working data

961
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,319
sets for detection and blocking and so on.

963
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,960
Also providing information on false

964
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:24,319
positives and some information that

965
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,640
you provided to the community turns out to be false

967
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,960
or something that is no longer relevant

968
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,39
getting information that is valid as

969
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,278
well so pretty much everyone has

970
00:30:33,38 --> 00:30:36,398
information to share by just using the information and running

972
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:44,0
1836.399 --> 1844
into frustration with the data by itself.

973
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,640
Also besides not having information to share

975
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,399
there comes also the issue of time.

976
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:51,759
Most of us are overburdened with

977
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:52,798
the different tasks that we are facing nowadays

979
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,599
so taking extra time out of the day to

981
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,38
encode information and to share it out in the community

983
00:31:01,38 --> 00:31:04,558
is obviously going to be an extra burden

984
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,600
there is no way around it. 

985
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:07,440
What we try to do with MISP

986
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,38
is to make this process as minimal as

987
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,0
1867.44 --> 1870
possible but it is going to be a time investment in the end, after all

989
00:31:10,0 --> 00:31:13,839
1870 --> 1873.84
especially if you want to vet the data if you want to ensure that 

992
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:19,240
the right data reaches the right recipients

994
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:26,240
This always has a time drain on you as well but in return this

996
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,79
is offset by what you gain by sharing that information we're

998
00:31:28,79 --> 00:31:31,359
going to talk about this a little bit

999
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,759
more during the community building part

1000
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,278
about what effects you're going to see

1001
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,640
if you're sharing information and why it is relevant for you

1003
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,120
but to basically sum it up in one sentence

1005
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,239
and whatever affects your organization

1006
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,679
is probably the most important information for you and if you get

1008
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,759
feedback on that, what you're seeing in your network

1010
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:52,398
and more eyes on it, more perspectives

1013
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,159
and perhaps more sophisticated methods of

1014
00:31:56,79 --> 00:31:59,519
research from other organizations

1015
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,600
then that will probably just improve

1016
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,519
your own security posture the best way it can.

1018
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,880
Now, besides timeliness and basically having information to share

1020
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,960
there's also the issue of different

1021
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,240
classification models so classification

1022
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,159
not just in a sense of of deciding who we share information with

1025
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,278
but how we classify information really

1026
00:32:18,79 --> 00:32:22,798
in terms of contextualizating it we are all used

1029
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,159
to naming things a certain way in our organizations in

1030
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,38
our communities and we've probably

1031
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:35,839
been doing it for longer than digital information systems exist 

1034
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,599
so we're probably using a lot of those

1035
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,639
vocabularies that we've been using for decades

1037
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,600
and what one of the things that we

1038
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,678
wanted to avoid with MISP is to

1039
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,639
get these communities to switch to a

1041
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,360
different way of describing things so if you already

1042
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,959
have your set methods, your set processes

1043
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,479
how you define things, we don't want to alter that so one of

1045
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,278
the things that we do with MISP and we are

1046
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,798
going to talk a fair bit about, tomorrow mostly

1048
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:03,679
is that you have ways to describe your

1049
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,0
1981.519 --> 1986
own taxonomies and your own vocabularies

1050
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,120
to use those in your community so very

1051
00:33:06,0 --> 00:33:08,558
1986 --> 1988.559
often when you're spinning up a

1052
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,199
community and when you're starting out

1053
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:10,879
with the sharing community,

1055
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,320
a national sharing community, sectorial one, whatever

1056
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,399
then one of the first tasks is basically

1057
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,720
defining those common vocabularies

1058
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,639
that you're going to be using

1059
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,319
now apart from the vocabularies

1060
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,38
themselves there is also the issue of

1061
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:25,839
of us speaking many different languages

1063
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,519
in terms of of our tools using different formats

1065
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,919
so that means even within our own organization which is

1066
00:33:32,79 --> 00:33:34,639
rather small we have a set of different tools

1068
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,559
that will ingest data in different formats

1070
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,240
or will prefer to ingest data in given

1071
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,119
format so one of the things we also try to do with MISP

1073
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,798
is to act as a hub for all your different tools

1075
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,519
that will get their data translated into

1076
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,960
the format that they can best ingest.

1077
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,839
Obviously this is something where we cannot be completely

1079
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:01,519
100 percent covering all the other

1080
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,879
things that exist out there. 

1081
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,558
So one of the things we try to do with MISP

1082
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,399
is make it as modular as possible and

1083
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:07,278
it's easy to encode your own formats as possible.

1085
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:13,440
We're not going to go deeply into how to do this during the training

1087
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,39
but if anyone is interested about that just

1089
00:34:15,39 --> 00:34:17,599
let us know and we'll point you in the

1090
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:19,598
right direction where you can find

1091
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,159
documentation on how to modularize and

1093
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,159
how to build import and export in MISP.

1094
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,560
So just one side note, all the training

1095
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,320
materials are available online

1096
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,599
like {inaduiable} mentioned we have a Github

1097
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,599
repository with a pretty extensive README files with all

1099
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,39
the material that we provide, there is a MISP book too which includes a

1101
00:34:41,39 --> 00:34:45,838
lot of reference to MISP as you know MISP has a 

1103
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,159
pretty large topic coming from technical aspect and

1105
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,480
you will see that in a minute about the project overview.

1107
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,519
So don't hesitate to go there on the MISP training

1109
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,639
page on Github this one is a good

1110
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:02,639
reference because it's really pointing

1111
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:05,920
to the different elements

1112
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,239
that we have. We have a huge slide deck of

1114
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,559
close to 500 pages of slide deck on the

1115
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,679
MISP book we have close to 500 pages. I

1116
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,440
would not mention the number of pages

1117
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:14,719
for taxonomies, galaxies and so on. It's quite large too

1119
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,39
but really look at this as a kind of way

1120
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,239
to shape it to what you like.

1121
00:35:19,39 --> 00:35:23,519
So it's really there to help you and if

1122
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,439
you see something missing

1123
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,800
let us know but we have slides, 

1125
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,200
for example system requirements, things like

1126
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:32,960
for example building community that

1127
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,439
we'll talk tomorrow, that's

1128
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,599
part of it but for more the

1129
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,320
programmatic aspect, API

1130
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,200
how to integrate with MISP {inaduiable JSON/taxono},

1131
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,39
how to extend it too

1132
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,799
there are plenty of slides regarding that

1133
00:35:43,39 --> 00:35:46,800
so it's really a good reference

1134
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,560
and thanks to {inaduiable} to share this

1135
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,800
information on the chat

1136
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,719
so to just give a quick overview of the MISP project and really to show that

1138
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,399
the project is quite large nowadays

1139
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,838
we basically have like four pillars of things in MISP

1141
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,199
one is obviously the open software itself

1143
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,78
so the initial version in {inaduaible} it was

1144
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,239
the small first small block there

1145
00:36:08,79 --> 00:36:11,440
the MISP core software which is like just the software

1147
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,400
mainly for the LMAP aspect where

1148
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,920
you have the backend, the web interface,

1149
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,760
and so on but over the time the project extended

1151
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,40
with multiple things so if you look on the Github

1152
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,800
repository of mid project we have around 50 repositories so

1154
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,720
it's pretty large. Just to summarize what

1155
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,119
are the different one

1156
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,919
we have for example the MISP modules um

1158
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,119
which is an easy way to extend MISP so the behavior of MISP

1160
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,880
on the expansion side on the import, export and so on by just writing

1162
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,480
python modules it's super easy to develop and use

1164
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,920
and the idea behind is obviously to

1165
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:50,960
2206 --> 2210.96
extend MISP without knowing

1166
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,440
the core details about the system 

1167
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,358
then we have a library called PyMISP and this

1168
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,639
PyMISP library is basically a

1169
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:02,319
python library to expose the new MISP platform API

1171
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,39
so MISP has a large REST api this one can be quite large but

1173
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:11,679
by MISP is really helping you to for example {inaduiable jest/Get} events

1174
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,200
create feeds and stuff like that so it's

1175
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,358
really important if you want to

1176
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,39
extend MISP to have a look at PyMISP that

1177
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,480
is not the only library for extending

1179
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,440
MISP some in golang you have some

1180
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,639
other in python too, you have others in java and so on

1182
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,0
2244.64 --> 2248
but the PyMISP one is the one that

1183
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,199
is maintained by the author of MISP so it is maintained by us

1186
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,399
and you can have a look at this one it's

1187
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,0
2252.48 --> 2256
really the one that's up to date it's

1188
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,0
2254.4 --> 2258
really core and part of the system too

1189
00:37:36,0 --> 00:37:40,400
2256 --> 2260.4
because we use it for our own tests

1190
00:37:38,0 --> 00:37:42,320
2258 --> 2262.32
within MISP then we have different

1191
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,358
repository i will just mention one which is

1193
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:46,559
dashboard, the dashboard is an extension module

1195
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,838
in MISP using what we call the ZeroMQ feed in MISP

1196
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,159
so we have a kind of way to have kind of a real-time feed

1198
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,799
in MISP you can {inaudiable} and

1199
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,639
so on but we wanted to show an example

1200
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,240
application for that and the MISP

1201
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,879
dashboard is exactly that

1202
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,559
is a way to really get all the

1203
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,960
information that you have in MISP

1204
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,920
into a very nice dashboard and so on

1205
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,760
this is really to have a good example of what you can do

1207
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,240
with information within MISP and how you can use it

1209
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:17,519
so that's the main pillar you have

1210
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:18,79
plenty of other projects but those one are the main ones

1212
00:38:18,79 --> 00:38:22,400
on top of that you have

1213
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,358
what we call the intelligent and knowledge database of

1215
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,119
MISP and just mentioned about the difficulty

1217
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,280
sometimes in some organizations to use a

1218
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,519
{inaudiable proper/corporate} classification and so on

1219
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,40
and we try to ease this in this

1220
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,639
different organization by having a kind

1221
00:38:35,39 --> 00:38:37,279
of library of all the taxonomies that exist

1223
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,519
so we started as a very simple one where

1224
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,358
it was just including for example a

1225
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,440
taxonomy like the traffic light protocol one, FIRST is using it

1227
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,119
and it's a commonly used classification but over

1228
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:50,320
the time we have seen that many

1229
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,720
organizations have different

1230
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,320
classification and so on. So we already

1231
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:55,838
in advance we prepare all those taxonomies in

1233
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,599
possible information {inaudiable} expose MISP

1234
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,399
and you can enable the one that you want

1235
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,39
so we have around 150 libraries now

1236
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,680
ranging from classifications, specific one for

1238
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:10,559
intelligence communities and some

1239
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,399
other activities so this one is our

1240
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,440
really useful label and you can just

1241
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,39
{inaudiable share/pick} the one that you want and we maintain those one

1243
00:39:15,39 --> 00:39:18,880
so we have some that are coming from

1244
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,39
third party, some that we are collecting

1245
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,39
as each projects are creating.

1246
00:39:21,39 --> 00:39:24,719
It's really usually a good source to see

1247
00:39:23,39 --> 00:39:26,838
how other communities are using

1248
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,639
classifying and contextualizing the

1249
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:30,480
information, there nevertheless the

1250
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:35,759
taxonomy itself was like kind of labels, those labels were quite small

1253
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,960
so it was not like completely extensive information so

1255
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,39
over the time we maintain a kind of more extensive one called the galaxy

1257
00:39:41,39 --> 00:39:47,279
you will hear the term very often

1258
00:39:44,79 --> 00:39:49,200
those galaxies are defining many things

1259
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,40
for example one of the most common one is the threat actor

1261
00:39:50,39 --> 00:39:54,400
we have a huge database of threat actors but a lot of

1262
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,400
times it was extended

1263
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,320
for example, Microsoft is not using

1264
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,358
threat actors for example there is this activity group is part of the

1266
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:05,119
galaxy, it's really one that we

1267
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,760
use for different and you can represent whatever

1269
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,280
galaxy you want so you have a predefined

1270
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:10,960
set of existing one but you can create your own 

1272
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,400
so if you have your own threat actor database

1273
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,480
you can create your own from scratch or

1274
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,280
you can reuse and fork existing ones so

1275
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,480
that's really those kind of things that we manage in

1277
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,920
the project is not only code and software

1278
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,39
we manage those kind of knowledge base

1280
00:40:23,39 --> 00:40:27,759
for intelligent {inaudiable} organization

1281
00:40:26,79 --> 00:40:29,200
we have some specific one like the notice list

1283
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:32,480
this one is a pretty small one that you use for the GDPR aspect

1285
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,480
but this one can be used for anything you want,

1287
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,960
It's for informing the analyst or the user of MISP when he

1288
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:41,440
touched some specific information in MISP

1290
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,280
that could impact for example the legal framework and so on

1292
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,280
it's actively use in the intelligence community,

1293
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,960
law enforcement and so on maybe less in

1294
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,880
security operation center but it's

1295
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,880
coming more and more due to the legal

1296
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,240
side of information sharing and

1297
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,480
especially storing information that might contain personal information

1299
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,480
then we have another one called the

1300
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:08,159
warning list and Andras quickly mentioned this kind of recurring problems or false positives

1303
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:12,719
and the one in MISP are basically list of existing potential false positives

1305
1306
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,439
for example we have lists of well-known IP addresses from Microsoft, for example.

1308
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,800
We have list of things like domain names used by Google and so on

1310
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,599
that's already helping users to find out

1311
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,119
if something might be a false positive

1312
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,559
and we do that automatically and we

1313
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,800
maintain those libraries because one {inaudiable MISP/reason} they're automatically updated regularly

1315
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,79
I think we have around 50 lists nowadays

1318
00:41:34,79 --> 00:41:38,160
It's really useful when you do on a day-to-day basis and creating events and

1320
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,838
so on you can really find and spot things that might be a false positive in advance

1323
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:48,0
2503.119 --> 2508
by having those warning lists enabled

1324
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,839
and again it's up to the user to select

1325
00:41:48,0 --> 00:41:53,39
2508 --> 2511.04
one {inaudiable} warning list or to enable everything depending on the different use case

1328
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,920
so that's one of those {inaudiable} pillar

1329
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,519
knowledge base i mean a lot of

1330
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,519
contributions coming from threat parties

1332
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,480
are coming from that aspect so it's not really programmers

1333
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,679
or coders that are contributing there

1334
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,599
but it's more analysts and people doing really threat intelligence

1336
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,160
or classification and so on 

1337
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,79
is really something that is useful for everyone

1338
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,159
without being your direct contributions on the code

1340
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,719
then over the times we we we became a kind of de facto standard and

1342
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,480
uh nowadays is even more than a de facto standard, is a standard

1344
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,199
We published as an interesting engineering task force draft

1346
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,439
all those documents especially the core format

1348
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,200
and to ease that for the development of external tools
1350
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,279
integration and so on. 

1351
00:42:38,0 --> 00:42:40,119
2558 --> 2561.119
So if you're interested you can go to the

1352
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,319
MISP platform website where we describe the different standards that we

1354
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,199
published. We even co-host standards that are for people

1356
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,598
integrating with MISP

1357
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,599
and we have specific standards for example for the object template

1359
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,800
and that's something that we will talkabout but that's something that was

1360
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,79

1361
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,839
really a need for us from the early beginning of MISP

1363
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:02,799
a lot of organizations want to have their own structure of information

1365
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,880
about objects and so on and we have a flexible model in MISP to

1367
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,358
really create your own data models and this one is standardized too

1369
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,358
and it's really helping sharing communities to

1371
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,318
extend MISP as they wish and their models without breaking the

1373
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,79
the standards itself so that's really interesting for for showing you new models

1376
00:43:24,79 --> 00:43:28,79
and then next to that we will do everything possible to help community

1378
00:43:28,79 --> 00:43:31,359
and Andras just mentioned the question of the

1380
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,679
legal aspect and i think maybe some of

1381
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,640
you already have this order to

1382
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,399
seek legal team about the information sharing policies and so on

1384
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,880
we try to make it easier so we publish this kind of compliance document

1386
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,160
and so on it's part of the MISP project

1387
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:50,879
everything is open source again so everything we do is open source and

1389
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,760
on open access. You can reuse it and so on. We have for example a specific

1391
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,679
document about building communities which is something that we do within the X-ISAC project

1394
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:08,960
and it's containing kind of best practices what are kind of agreement that you can

1397
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,119
use when doing a setup of sharing communities.

1399
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,440
Up to things about how to do contextualization and so on

1400
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,40
so that's that's maybe something that

1401
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,519
for an organization that wants to boost up an ISAC or sharing communities they can

1404
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,760
look at those documents and so on so it's again a thing that we try to help

1406
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,800
for example we produce kind of OSINT feeds of existing reports and so on to

1408
00:44:30,800 -->  00:44:36,880
not only have software ready but to have some content and to show what kind of

1411
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,559
information can be shared within different MISP communities.

1413
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,880
So let us some get some of the naming conventions out of the way

1415
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,880
before we start with the hands-on stuff and

1416
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:58,719
just a quick explanation of the different uh data points and uh and naming conventions

1419
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,400
that we use for them so it's a bit easier afterwards

1421
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:08,0
this can be a bit overwhelming, don't worry we'll go through everything step by step also

1424
00:45:04,639 --> 
during the hands-on part 

1426
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:13,440
So basically all the data that goes into MISP, we separate into two main layers

1427
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:14,880
one we call data layer which is really everything it has to do with

1429
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:22,0
individual data points their compositioning and so on

1432
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,358
So everything that we share in MISP in general in this regard

1433
00:45:22,0 --> 00:45:25,199
2722 --> 2725.2
starts with something that we call an event, these are our general

1435
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:28,559
envelopes for information so that means that

1437
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,960
whenever we're describing an incident, we're describing a threat report 

1439
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,0
2732.96 --> 2736
we're describing a watch list that we recurringly update

1441
00:45:36,0 --> 00:45:40,400
2736 --> 2740.4
and they will all be grouped into something that we call an event

1443
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,680
So the name is a little bit controversial at times, we try to pick a name

1445
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,519
that is the least amount of a loaded term that we could find

1448
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,240
but obviously even with that there it can be a bit confusing but just consider

1450
00:45:56,239 --> 
it as a generic container for data that has some contextual linking
 
1453
00:45:59,39 --> 00:46:06,318
then each of these events is populated with lists of attributes. 

1455
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:09,838
So attributes are the most basic data points in MISP

1457
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,279
an attribute can describe for example an IP address

1459
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:21,199
you can describe a file hash or it can describe a car plate number for example

1462
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:27,759
It's basically just an individual data point with some basic context around it

1465
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,800
such as describing in what context this was seen in

1467
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,960
what type we're using to describe the attribute, 

1469
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,679
for example that we're using an MD5 hash to describe the hash of a file

1471
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:44,318
would be one of those descriptions, hopefully not used as much these days

1473
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:51,920
but that's just an example and then we can take these individual attributes

1476
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,318
and composite them into what we call objects that are describing multifaceted concepts.

1478
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:59,440
For example, a file object would be described by a list of attributes

1480
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:05,760
including a file name, different file hashes, maybe file entropy and so on and so forth.

1484
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,440
Each of these individual objects and attributes can then be further interlinked by what we call references.

1487
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,119
So that means that most of the time when we're describing data in MISP 

1489
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,0
we're trying to tell a story so we're thinking graphs instead of individual data points

1492
00:47:20,0 --> 00:47:24,559
2840 --> 2844.559
that means that we can for example, describe the entire flow of an attack

1494
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,79
from the initial attack vector all the way to the exploitation

1496
00:47:28,79 --> 00:47:33,599
using the interconnected graphs using these references so we could say

1498
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,960
initially it all started with an email that was received

1500
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,559
that contained for example a malicious sample which then had to send this effect

1503
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,838
in our infrastructure so all of these different steps can be then described

1506
00:47:45,0 --> 00:47:53,519
2868 --> 2873.52
via different references there then to aggregate this information

1508
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,79
into and aggregate the sightings of this information via structure

1510
00:47:58,79 --> 00:48:02,280
that basically captures sightings from our different information sources 

1512
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,760
that means if you have an IDS that is generating alerts

1514
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,640
you can feed information back on when individual attributes were seen

1516
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:16,159
in your network, in your premises or at your partners and so on

1518
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,920
so this is basically it for the data layer, these are our main building blocks for that.

1521
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,599
now in order to contextualize this information, we have different tools at our disposal.

1523
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,160
The most simple one is what we call tags these are basic text labels that 

1525
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:35,598
we attach on individual data points or entire events

1527
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,440
and these can either be created freely or most commonly they come from what we call taxonomies.

1530
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,400
They're basically standardized vocabularies and that are either shared

1532
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:54,880
by us so the MISP project at large or by individual communities to their members so

1535
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,39
these vocabularies can include anything from for example something is simple and

1537
00:48:57,39 --> 00:49:01,279
and commonly used as TLP to national classifications 

1540
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:08,719
to various different sectoral classifications and so on

1541
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:12,79
now if you wanted to provide more high-level information instead of just simple

1544
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,640
labels for the information we can use what we call galaxy clusters

1546
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,400
so galaxy cluster is basically a knowledge based element that we use as a label

1549
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,879
these can be either coming from standard libraries 

1551
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,480
such as the ones that we maintain or you can create them ad-hoc in MISP.

1553
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,0
That means if you're describing a threat actor 

1555
00:49:30,0 --> 00:49:35,358
you could create create a threat actor galaxy cluster that describes the various metadata

1557
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:38,558
about the threat actor and then use this to label your data whenever you think

1560
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,160
that whatever you're describing is associated with a threat actor

1562
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:46,480
you can also create for example a galaxy cluster describing the different

1564
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:53,760
target sectors and then interlink using cluster relationships

1566
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:04,559
the threat actor galaxy clusters with target sectors with exploited TTP and so on and so forth

1569
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,39
So these are the high level structures that you can put on top of your data 

1572
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:14,838
basically to further contextualize it. Alex

1574
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:21,39
Yeah, so just to summarize it and that's always a lot of people are asking about it

1577
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:26,319
how do you summarize it about, for example in easy way you have to see really

1580
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,838
MISP {inaudiable environment/development} as an envelope and then you

1581
00:50:28,79 --> 00:50:32,318
have information inside and then what Andras describe is basically

1583
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:34,800
different component that you have within that envelope and then you have

1586
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:42,480
contextual layers on that envelope and relationship that are basically based on on that.

1589
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:50,400
So, another thing that is very often and I think it is good to explain it, is about the

1592
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,119
terminology between indicators, attributes, and so on that is

1594
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,358
a different especially indicator of compromise and so on

1596
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,440
In MISP, an attribute is close to an indicator

1598
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,599
and we have this kind of flexible models where

1600
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,200
maybe some of you are familiar with observables in MISP

1602
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,440
we call it attributes and those observables are basically depending on the type

1605
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,0
So, we have a specific flag in attributes which is basically defining

1608
00:51:20,0 --> 00:51:23,599
3080 --> 3083.599
if information can be used automatically for detection

1610
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:29,960
and that's i think one of the most important aspects when we talk about attribute in MISP

1613
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,119
an attribute can become an observable or become an indicator of compromise

1615
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,880
depending on the simple flag and this is quite important because

1618
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:43,599
a lot of analysis and so on will depend on that and especially all you will use that afterwards

1621
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,39
if you plan for example to use the data into a protective systems and so on 
 
1624
00:51:48,39 --> 00:51:54,79
the IDS flags need to be set so the thing is if i take an example 

1626
00:51:54,79 --> 00:51:56,480
you reverse the malware and this malware is connected to google.com for testing the connectivity

1629
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:04,79
obviously you will have an attribute for example www.google.com

1632
00:52:03,79 --> 00:52:09,440
and this one is an interesting indicator for information for the analyst

1634
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,0
so like that you can for example maybe cluster those kind of malware together as in this kind of behavior

1637
00:52:14,0 --> 00:52:19,279
3134 --> 3136.64
nevertheless you are not really interested in that information as an indicator of compromise

1641
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,480
because it will generate a huge amount of false positive 

1644
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,640
but if for example at some point you have an IP address that is really dedicated to that malware 

1646
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:39,719
then you will set the IDS flag, so the thing is when you define in MISP these flags

1649
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,599
and we will show you later on it's very important because it will define what you can do 

1652
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:48,639
3164 --> 3166.64
with information later on if you're going to automate and so on like

1655
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,239
In MISP, what we try to do too instead of having just indicators

1657
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:57,280
it's very common and i think many of you know about it you might see for example 

1660
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,599
a list of hashes so like for example MD5 hashes without any context

1662
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,280
and sometimes it's difficult to know exactly what we are talking about

1664
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,599
Are we talking about MD5 of malicious sample, are we talking about md5 of legitimate software,

1667
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:17,39
are we talking about the MD5 value of the X.509 certificate, 

1669
00:53:17,39 --> 00:53:29,719
are we talking about an MD5 as a mutex in memory 

1670
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:25,759
we have plenty of way of seeing those kind of MD5 so we try in MISP to have what we call the

1673
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:30,318
kind of i would not say {inaudiable keep shine/kill shine} but at least contextualization a category that

1675
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:35,279
help to see in which context this has been seen

1677
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:41,119
and as for example if 1 MD5 might have a payload delivery, telling that in which scope this has been set

1680
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,440
So that means in MISP we have always and complementary type

1682
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:52,639
so for example for an MD5 files you can say that this one is from a file or is an md5 of a fingerprint thing

1686
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:59,679
So that means, always in MISP try to have as an indicator all those three information together 

1689
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:06,639
so it is giving at least more context and if you cannot set this context MISP will try to automatically set it.

1692
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:12,239
So attributes are equal to indicators but with a bit more of information which is useful for you

1695
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:19,358
At least being in a way to understand what is in a position to understand what you have in front of you

1699
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:28,400
when you have to treat those attributes.

1700
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:29,920
So this is just a brief view of what this looks like. 

1702
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:36,239
We're going to see this more in practice basically the idea is that all the data that we have in  MISP

1705
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:43,798
if it's well defined allows us to draw a graph out of the data and allows us to tell a story more easily

1708
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:55,798
So here we see a simple example that basically shows the bank account that is associated with the threat actor

1712
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,679
With all the various different data points with it and then we can basically relate these

1715
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,200
different data points to each other and give the relationship a term as well 

1718
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,160
So in this case we see from the chart immediately there that that person is the owner of that

1720
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:13,119
bank account with all those different data points for us as humans it's it's generally much more

1724
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,839
easily understood if we look at a graph like that and tell the story that way 

1727
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:22,480
then if we look at a tabularized view of the data.

1728
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:24,239
So one of the goals and something that we hope that we get out of 
 
1731
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:32,480
going through trainings like these is to really convert also the participants

1732
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:38,558
to to see the value of producing data in that way instead of just sharing raw indicator lists for example.

1735
00:55:40,0 --> 00:55:45,199
3340 --> 3343.2
And that's again what we think that's really important is the contextualization again.

1738
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,480
So i mentioned we have the galaxies in MISP and we have plenty of representation

1741
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:55,838
threat actors and so on and obviously one that is quite important is the MITRE Attack one

1744
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,759
so MITRE Attack is {inaduiable stored/performed} as a galaxy

1746
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,520
and we have this flexible {inaduiable mosaic/table} in MISP that you can represent those kind of

748
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:07,39
matrix-like model which is a case for Attack which is a very convenient way of representing the 

1752
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:14,480
different techniques in a progressive way used by the attackers and that's exactly what we can do in MISP. 

1755
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:22,79
So you have this kind of model and we have different model formats so again we have an advanced

1758
00:56:22,79 --> 00:56:30,838
i would say integration with Attack but you can extend it with multiple different kinds of galaxies which are

1762
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:33,838
3390 --> 3393.839
similar to Attack or complementary for example we have the Industrial Control System of Attack,

1765
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,440
it's a separated galaxy, you can even create a custom one directly in the system 

1768
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,519
and then you can filter out your data and so on and that's exactly the thing why we are i would say

1771
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,480 
in bracket pushing people to do more contextualization, it would be useful forthem at the end

1774
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:58,960
because this kind of information is really showing you for example your gap in your defense

1778
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,720
your specific things that the techniques that are not used by an attacker 

1780
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,279
you might ask why, maybe because you are missing a specific detection point that you cannot

1783
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:12,239
detect this kind of attacks or things like that so it's really actively using the data

1786
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:15,759
to show something meaningful with it and i think Attack is one of the way

1788
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,119 
but if you can combine this with additional information like site links, 

1789
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,239
contextualization of the relationship between different objects and so on

1792
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,558
basically everything in hand to improve your posture and secure it.

1794
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,0
Yeah perhaps something to add to this as well,

1796
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:33,838
some of the additional advantages is the moment that you encode all this information along

1798
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:39,39
with the data you can start asking those those questions from your tool basically

1800
00:57:39,39 --> 00:57:47,838
for example show me what sort of threats my constituency is facing over the past year

1804
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,760
and overlayed over how what sort of threats it was facing a year ago 

1806
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,319
what are the trends that have evolved since then

1808
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:58,960
the other thing that it really helps with is it also gives you a high level overview of individual reports

1811
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:06,78
that means if I'm looking at an event in MISP and it has 800 different attributes described in there

1815
00:58:06,79 --> 00:58:10,719
making any sense out of that quickly is very difficult, but getting a high level overview using MITRE Attack

1818
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:16,239
where you say oh okay this has to deal with spearphishing, it has to deal with information exfiltration,

1821
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:22,79
so these immediately tell me the story of what i'm dealing with without having to dig deeper into the data itself

1825
00:58:22,79 --> 00:58:27,480
so it is incredibly useful for an analyst that is trying to make sense of the data that you're sharing.

1828
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:36,0
Also, as for the sharing itself i mean one of the main goals with MISP is obviously to share information,

1831
00:58:36,0 --> 00:58:43,280
We haven't really talked about the sharing mechanisms yet, we basically have a bunch of different functionalities in MISP

1834
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,639
that we're going to see over the next two days the deal with distributing the information.

1838
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:55,280
One of the most obvious ones to tackle is basically who is to be the recipient of information that we're sharing

1842
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:04,400
so basically MISP, we can basically set the distribution settings for each individual data point individually

1846
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,760
or for entire collections of data in one shot so that means if we create an event we can decide who we share the event with 

1849
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,160
but we can further restrict individual attributes or objects further. 

1854
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:26,79
Now, who we share the information with gets decided on using one of two different means,

1857
00:59:25,79 --> 00:59:29,39
one of them is a simple system where we tell MISP you are allowed to distribute it to everyone 

1858
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,280
that has access to this community, for example.

1860
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:39,440
Or to everyone that is directly connected to my community but you can also define more strict distribution lists

1863
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:44,400
what we call sharing groups where you individually name the organizations that are to be the recipients.

1868
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:52,159
Now on top of that, one of the things that we often struggle with is especially if you're in some of those communities

1872
00:59:51,159 --> 01:00:01,39
or you're taking part or assisting some of the communities where sharing any information might lead to reputation or financial loss.

1876
01:00:01,39 --> 01:00:04,318
For example in the financial sector we have these worries very often

1878
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:08,318
where if a financial organization were to share any information out

1880
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:11,838
it could be misconstrued as a successful attack against them.

1882
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:15,719
So instead, they choose to basically even if it was something completely benign

1884
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,239
that they caught in their sandboxes, in their honeypots, whatever

1887
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:24,399
and they decide not to share it out of fear of incurring this reputation loss.

1889
01:00:24,399 --> 01:00:29,440
So one of the things that we have in MISP is this system called Delegation 

1891
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,920
where you can, for example appoint your ISAC,
 
1892
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:38,558
your central authority for a community, a national CSIRT, whatever 

1893
01:00:38,558 --> 01:00:41,599
with the responsibility of taking over the data that you produce

1898
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,480
and to share it out in their name  

1900
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:48,838
so that way, it's basically a semi anonymized information sharing 

1901
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,880
where you are completely removed from the data that is shared out

1903
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,500
so the only two parties that will know who the originator of the data is you

1904
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:01,500
and whoever is taking over the data and taking over responsibility for the data.

1909
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:05,280
On top of that, one of the things that we wanted to achieve with MISP 

1911
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,720
was basically to build a collaboration with our different partners

1913
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:11,519
so it means that whenever we're sharing information we don't want it to

1915
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:14,358
be a one-way communication, so we don't want to have 

1916
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:17,500
this whole feed, provider and consumers relationship 

1919
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,798
but we want everyone to be able to chip in with their ideas

1920
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,559
so while anything that you produce in MISP will only be tied and editable

1921
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,719
by your organization, others can make proposals or counter analysis to it.

1924
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,919
So proposals are a system where you can basically flag information

1926
01:01:32,919 --> 01:01:37,0
as incorrect and provide feedback on how to improve it 

1928
01:01:37,0 --> 01:01:40,0
or how you can add your own perspective to an event,

1930
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:42,0
so if you receive an event from a third party you can say 

1931
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:44,400
oh i can improve it and {inaudiable listen/discern} this way

1932
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,8
please incorporate these changes in the event

1933
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:49,500
and then the original producer can make the decision 

1935
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,519
whether to incorporate it or discard your changes.

1936
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,358
As for counter analysis, this is what we call extend events.

1938
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:59,358
You can basically create an event that latches onto an original 

1940
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,38
shared by a third party and provide your own perspective of it.

1942
01:02:03,0 --> 01:02:06,160
and then you keep full control of the data and you become the owner

1945
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,440
of whatever the extension is that you produce to the original event.

1946
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:17,280
This happens very often for us, for example when a vendor shares out a report.

1949
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,0
For example, we get a report from say kaspersky and we have additional information 

1951
01:02:20,0 --> 01:02:25,519
or we have a different opinion on something, 

1954
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:29,960
then we might create an extended event that we share out to our constituency 

1957
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,358
which if they have access to the original report will latch onto it

1958
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:37,0
and it will show our perspective on top of the original.

1960
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:41,440
Now as for the exchange itself, every organization is free to host their own

1962
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,960
MISP instance and then they can decide who they want to interconnect with

1964
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,240
if both parties agree, a synchronization link is established

1966
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:51,838
between the two MISP instance and sharing can start flowing between them.

1968
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:55,0
Now this sharing is still governed by those distribution lists 

1970
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,199
and by some other mechanism that we'll talk about more tomorrow 

1972
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:04,0
but basically MISP exchanges information between the individual nodes

1974
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,880
in kind of a mesh network way.

1976
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,0
We also have feed system that allows us to generate feeds

1977
01:03:10,0 --> 01:03:11,960
and to share those feeds with larger communities.

1979
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,559
So we as CIRCL we provide another SIEM feed, for example

1980
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,0
that we make freely available in our infrastructure

1981
01:03:20,0 --> 01:03:22,440
anyone can just point their MISP to it and adjust the data

1983
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,119
and keep it updated using the feed system, this is also great

1985
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:30,0
if you have ever have the need of sharing information between air gap systems.

1986
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:37,0
You can just generate a feed based on certain filter rules and basically

1989
01:03:37,0 --> 01:03:43,0
share it through say a flash drive or something like that, with an internal system

1993
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:48,720
Now all of these filtering options are basically user defined

1994
01:03:48,0 --> 01:03:50,880
and they rely heavily also on the contextualization  

1997
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,0
so very often what we're doing and especially

1998
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:57,0
if you were ever signing up for the COVID instance that i mentioned before

2000
01:03:57,0 --> 01:04:00,559
is you can also make those decisions based on the context, 

2002
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,960
what data you're interested in, what date you're interested in sharing out.

2004
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,400
For example, if you connect to COVID instance, we categorize all of the

2006
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,79
information into three categories, health related information

2008
01:04:9,79 --> 01:04:12,720
so basically information about the spread of the pandemic,

2010
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:16,399
information about misinformation targeting COVID,

2012
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:22,0
and also cyber security threats that are targeting, that are now basically 

2014
01:04:21,0 --> 01:04:27,0
abusing the whole COVID situation with remote work and so on.

2016
01:04:27,0 --> 01:04:30,0
so if you're only interested in one or two of these three different topics,

2019
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:36,0
then you can set up your filters to only ingest data coming from a subset of the data set

2021
01:04:36,0 --> 01:04:39,0
Very often what we do as well is we have these internal MISP clusters

2023
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:44,0 
in our own organization as well, where we collect information from different sources

2026
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:48,798
so we have a dedicated MISP instance where we purely collect spam information for example

2029
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:52,0
So for a constituency, anyone can forward their spam to us

2031
01:04:52,0 --> 01:04:55,358
and we'll just generate events out of those in that MISP. 

2032
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:56,38
Generally this information 

2033
01:04:56,38 --> 01:05:00,480
is really not interesting for a day-to-day detection use, for example.

2036
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,679
But what we do is we cache this information and we can cross-correlate

2038
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:05,759
this information with our operational instance

2040
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,839
that means if we start the analysis process and we start an investigation

2042
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:14,239
then we immediately see the moment we start encoding data points

2044
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,598
oh this is something that was already flagged once in our spam instance

2046
01:05:18,598 --> 01:05:210,359
this information that that instance knows about, 

2048
01:05:210,359 --> 01:05:24,840
then we can pivot over to that instance and fetch the information

2049
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,400
related to that same data point that we're also seeing in our current incident

2052
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,0
and perhaps get more information that is relevant for us from there.

2054
01:05:32,0 --> 01:05:35,79
3932 --> 3936.079
So basically very often we have these multi MISP internal enclaves

2057
01:05:35,79 --> 01:05:42,0
that help us basically to separate different concerns and

2058
01:05:41,0 --> 01:05:44,0
different collection mechanisms into their own instances.

2060
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,39
Just in that scope and I think is linked to the question that we had

2062
01:05:49,39 --> 01:05:52,799
regarding the multi MISP internal enclave

2064
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:57,599
someone was asking about synchronizing with an existing MISP and so.

2066
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,720
You have this kind of local enclave options, where you can synchronize to MISP

2068
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:05,199
like they behave in the same organization, that's one of the interesting options.

2071
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,358
By the way, I would just give the mic to Josh that will explain a bit more about 

2074
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:16,0
the question and answer in zoom, to have directly the ability to answer the question answering the Zoom {inaudiable}

2077
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,639
I just want to jump in real quick, yeah if you have any questions 

2080
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:26,400
please direct them at the Q&A board versus the chat room 

2081
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,0
that way we can kind of keep a monitor of that 

2082
01:06:28,0 --> 01:06:32,0
and other people can actually see the questions and the answer directly in that area

2085
01:06:32,0 --> 01:06:38,0
so if you have questions feel free to use the Q&A board and that's all 

2086
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:43,199
thank you josh that's very useful so we can keep track of them and we can answer live or

2090
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,700
directly in the chat. 

2091
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:49,520
Okay great, so you see that the sharing aspect of MISP is like pretty extensive

2094
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,279
and you have different models of of usage of MISP 

2097
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:58,318
some people have this pre-conception about MISP being like oh I need to share with MISP 

2099
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:01,119
no, it's depending on what you want to do with your MISP instance

2101
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,500
and the core functionality of MISP is really to give, I would say the freedom 

2104
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:11,0
to each of the organizations to decide what to do with the data, if they want to share or not

2106
01:07:11,0 --> 01:07:17,359
and we always design MISP that everyone can be kind of consumers
 
2109
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,838
so that basically getting data from different fields or producer or contributors

2110
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:29,0
Andras mentioned a different way of contributing like sightings, making proposals, things like that

2114
01:07:29,0 --> 01:07:34,240
but it's up to the original contributors to decide if they want to share 

2117
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:41,119
that's really the thing, with MISP you can set up a MISP for like just pulling data, getting the data and that's it

2120
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:46,480
and if at one point in time you want to like push some data you can just enable it and that's it 

2123
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,0
so it's really, it's just a matter of just tuning the configuration ,

2126
01:07:51,0 --> 01:07:53,0
the filtering really on the synchronization, if you want to share.

2128
01:07:53,0 --> 01:07:55,838
So you don't have to change anything in your MISP instance

2129
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,0
it's just a matter of of what you decide and what you need to share

2132
01:07:59,0 --> 01:08:01,500
and then the thing that is really important in MISP

2133
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,760
everything can be in flex. I mean even for example that we were mentioning 

2135
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,240
so those kind of envelope information might change over time

2137
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:15,0
we have seen for example some past or incident report that has been updated like 

2140
01:08:15,0 --> 01:08:19,0
two years later because they discover who was the target or the threat actor behind

2142
01:08:19,0 --> 01:08:24,0
and that's the thing that's really in MISP that we really want to be flexible 

2145
01:08:24,0 --> 01:08:29,500
you can really expand the information either internally, add some comment and so on

2147
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:35,359
and to share this information in your different MISP instances and share with partners,

2150
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,200
your teams and so on so. 

2151
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:42,0
Really, MISP the core functionality of MISP is distributing information 

2153
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:46,500
but if you don't want to use it it's fine you just don't enable synchronization 

2156
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,0
but if you want to use partially, part of synchronization and so on 

2158
01:08:50,0 --> 01:08:53,838
you just set up this kind of parameters. 

2160
01:08:55,0 --> 01:09:00,0
So on top of collecting all this information

2161
01:09:00,0 --> 01:09:03,0
and synchronizing the information that we talked about before

2162
01:09:03,0 --> 01:09:06,0
we basically do a bunch of different stuff to improve 

2164
01:09:06,0 --> 01:09:08,0
to handle the quality management of the information as well.

2165
01:09:08,0 --> 01:09:11,0
So one of the first things we do, this is something we mentioned a bit before

2167
01:09:11,0 --> 01:09:16,0
is we correlate information so we're interested in data that we've already seen before

2170
01:09:16,0 --> 01:09:18,559
we also have the feedback loop that we mentioned before with sightings 

2172
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,0
that means we really want to get timeliness to the information as well

2175
01:09:22,0 --> 01:09:27,439
so that we can but make better decisions on what we keep in our working data set for detection,

2177
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,5
for blocking and so on.

2178
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,679
The false positive management is a huge part so the warning list system

2180
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:37,0
where we basically exclude those typical false positives

2182
01:09:37,0 --> 01:09:41,440
plays a very important role in the legal equation and this is also a community driven effort

2184
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:46,0
so if you want to get involved with that and build and include your own infrastructure 

2187
01:09:46,0 --> 01:09:48,399
for example in the warning list and so on,

2189
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:53,0
either do it internally for your MISP or just share it with the open source community as well

2191
01:09:53,0 --> 01:09:56,719
so let us know if you want to have that included as well 

2193
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,500
we haven't talked about enrichment systems yet 

2195
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,880
but basically one of the things that we do in MISP is 

2196
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,238 
we have connectors to all those different services that you might already be subscribed to

2199
01:10:05,238  --> 01:10:11,439
so if you have domain tools, passive total or what way or any of the other services

2202
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:15,439
intel 471, and so on that you already subscribed to, then you can use  

2205
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:19,600
those services to enrich the data that you're working on 

2208
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,0
so if you have an incident and you're encoding information 

2209
01:10:22,0 --> 01:10:24,640
you go out to all the services that you connect, that you have access to

2210
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,600
4224.64 --> 4228
and fetch the information on what else those systems know about the different data points that you're encoding

2213
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,679
so that you basically get a jump start on your investigation.

2215
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:37,119
Now one of the most important things that we have to deal with and this is probably 

2217
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:42,559
i think about 50% of the code base of MISP 

2219
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,560
is basically the APIs and the libraries that deal with integrating MISP with other tools

2221
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,580
so everything that we can do by the UI, MISP is also exposed to the api

2223
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:54,960
and one of the most important things for us is to make sure that

2225
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:00,0
you can use MISP as simply a backend for another tool as opposed to just directly using MISP itself.

2228
01:11:00,0 --> 01:11:04,640
As for timeliness, we haven't really touched on that yet.

2230
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,480
Besides the sighting aspect, you can also encode information about time ranges when something was seen

2233
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:19,200
and you can build a full timeline of the events that occurred during a cyber incident for example.

2237
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,719
So if you encode this information together with all your data points

2239
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,960
then you get an additional graph out of it that tells you when what happens

2241
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,0
and time-based correlations are really important as well.

2243
01:11:30,0 --> 01:11:33,599
So very often when you're seeing two things happening at the same time

2245
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,800
they might be related with each other and 

2248
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:40,960
they might be worth digging into whether there is a link between those two things that happened.

2250
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,480
So something else that we will touch on more tomorrow 

2251
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,200
is we have a full indicator lifecycle management system in MISP.

2254
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,0
That means you can define your own rules and tune your own rules 

2256
01:11:50,0 --> 01:11:53,500
on how you're going to be scoring and decaying indicators 

2257
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:57,119
based on all the contextualization that you have,

2258
01:11:57,119 --> 01:11:58,719
based on the type of the data that you have, 

2259
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,439
based on source of the information that you have and so on and so forth.

2260
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:09,0
So we're going to go into much more detail on that tomorrow. Alex.

2265
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:20,359
Yeah, so I was just answering a question and then I will make it public in a minute

2267
01:12:20,359 --> 01:12:25,639
that's a question about the API and using MISP. 

2270
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:30,0
There are different ways to evaluate the quality of the information that you share in MISP.

2273
01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:35,238
One of those is obviously to look at statistics, There is a statistics version in MISP to see 

2276
01:12:35,238 --> 01:12:40,238
for example, the kind of indicator shared by organization and so on.

2278
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:43,279
In addition to that, there is for example 

2279
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:46,279
MISP dashboard which includes a kind of gamification of the platforms

2281
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:53,600
and which is giving badges per organization depending on the kind of information that you share

2284
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:59,520
and that's a nice way to to find out if you are reaching a certain level of capabilities when using MISP

2287
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,360
where you basically have for example information like

2289
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:08,960
are you using sightings, do you use objects and stuff like that. 

2292
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,0
For example, thing that you can really look at if you want to see 

2293
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:14,480
if the quality of information that you create in MISP

2296
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:19,560
i would just following the standards what is following the best practices in the different organization

2297
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,640
is to compare with the {inaudiable} feed 

2300
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,198
there are some goods even in the OSINT feed and 

2301
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:29,519
for example, things that are really a good indicator is to see

2303
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,880
are you just using indicators and using objects, 

2305
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,0
are those objects linked together by using the relationship to it,

2306
01:13:35,0 --> 01:13:40,199
are you using galaxies, are those galaxies at the event level, {inaudiable} level,

2308
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:46,0
do you have tags,  labels on specific objects or specific attributes and so on

2311
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:52,960
that's different parameters and i think the question from {inaudiable} is pretty good.

2315
01:13:52,960 --> 01:14:00,39
and if you really want to dive into the KPI aspect of MISP and quality of information.

2316
01:14:00,39 --> 01:14:03,239
In addition to what Andras just said 

2320
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:07,600
there are some other things about the quality of information shared within the community

2321
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,920
and there's some good examples in the MISP dashboard about the different badges

2324
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,0
there is even a model for sharing such kind of information.

2326
01:14:16,0 --> 01:14:19,0
So another thing that is i think quite useful and 

2329
01:14:19,0 --> 01:14:23,520
it was one of the core functionality of MISP was the correlation features.

2330
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:29,119
This one is, it looks like obvious but it's not always obvious 

2332
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:32,800
I mean a lot of tools in the security field exist but they don't do automatic correlations.

2334
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,679
For example, at the {inaudiable} we are using ticketing system  

2337
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:39,0
and sometimes it's very difficult to find if we have two correlating events 

2338
01:14:39,0 --> 01:14:42,820
and what we decided in MISP which covers the cost. 

2339
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:48,800
I mean the correlation engine is maybe one of the costly aspects of using MISP on a database level.

2341
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,919
but it's really useful.

2342
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:52,500
For example, here we just have an example of 

2343
01:14:52,500 --> 01:15:00,500
information about some malware spam that are used to share uh information about

2348
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:04,239
target campaigns for the financial malware

2351
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:09,819
and what we can see there is basically correlation on similar points

2352
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:12,880
and those ones are mainly IP addresses of the infrastructure

2355
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,0
but you can really spot interesting things there.

2357
01:15:16,0 --> 01:15:19,679
For example, you see that the third {inaudiable bone/bin} in Germany share indicators,

2360
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:24,0
you have a polish bank sharing the same kind of indicators 

2361
01:15:24,0 --> 01:15:26,560
we were sharing such kind of indicators too

2362
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,640
and even if they have different names or different contextualization 

2365
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,439
we can really spot similar infrastructure 

2366
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:39,198
so we can see okay, it's maybe the same actors using an infrastructure for different kind of things

2369
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:45,679
or for example we can actually see here that we have different names of the similar malware 

2372
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,0
so really this is important for example another thing that is interesting is

2374
01:15:48,0 --> 01:15:53,739
for example if you have a sinkhole IP address setup by a antivirus company for example, 

2377
01:15:53,739 --> 01:15:57,560
you can directly spot it. I mean if you have, I don't know, APT 29 

2380
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:01,840
and you have like three different criminals malware going on that one and so on 

2383
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,600
obviously it's usually not the same infrastructures but on the other hand 

2385
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,39
you can directly spot, okay this one is already take down 

2386
01:16:08,39 --> 01:16:12,159
it's handled by this antivirus company and you can really handle it

2388
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:20,679
so it's really a way to quickly find if it's a new threat or something that is already known in the infrastructure

2392
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:28,640
So a little bit of the sightings themselves so we're going to see this more in practice

2395
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:36,79
basically we have a very simple interfacing list that allows us to to tell the community

2398
01:16:36,79 --> 01:16:40,158
that we've seen an indicator, as well as when we've seen it

2401
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:46,238
and perhaps also include information on what tool we've picked up, what context we've seen,

2402
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:50,359
so sightings can have some metadata on top of just being a sighting. 

2406
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:54,79
We can also flag something that we call negative sightings which is a false positive sighting

2409
01:16:54,79 --> 01:16:59,0
where we indicate that we've seen it but it produced issues for us so it was a false positive.

2412
01:16:59,0 --> 01:17:05,520
We can also indicate that something is potentially going to be expired at a certain date,

2415
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,0
so this is interesting, for example, if we're in talks with a provider 

2418
01:17:10,0 --> 01:17:11,519
and we know that there is going to be a takedown 

2420
01:17:11,519 --> 01:17:17,0
then we can already indicate that okay, this is no longer an indicator after a certain point in time.

2422
01:17:17,0 --> 01:17:21,679
Apart from that if you are ever dealing with bulk sightings,

2424
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:28,0
so if you want to for example just capture any IP address seen in your network or something like that

2427
01:17:28,0 --> 01:17:34,560
there is another tool called SightingDB, which is developed by Devo, it's also an open source tool.

2430
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,79
It's really recommended to use that, it allows you to to capture massive massive amounts of data

2432
01:17:38,79 --> 01:17:45,539
so if you're capturing the entire network flow of your constituency and or your organization 

2436
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:49,920
and just dumping all the data somewhere this is a great place to do it

2439
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,760
and it's a very fast lookup database that is integrated with MISP

2441
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,500
where MISP can automatically just query it for any of the indicators that you're seeing in MISP,

2445
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:05,359
and whether it was seen in your network, and in which time range it was seen in.

2446
01:18:03,0 --> 01:18:07,500
interesting thing with that is it's also for historical values 

2448
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:14,238
so if you're just doing bulk collection of all the observables in your network

2451
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:26,500
and then even half a year later if it turns out that a indicator is being shared with you 

2454
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,0
that correlates with an observable that SightingDB from half a year ago 

2456
01:18:27,0 --> 01:18:30,0 
then you know that you might need to launch an investigation into something

2459
01:18:30,0 --> 01:18:34,0
that happened half a year ago in logs and so on based on the historic look up. 

2460
01:18:38,0 --> 01:18:41,0
Alex

2462
01:18:41,0 --> 01:18:44,500
Just complementary notes regarding sightings and

2464
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:49,439
that's something that is basically maybe the easiest way of sharing additional information

2467
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:53,839
it costs nothing and if you are connected to a MISP instance

2468
01:18:53,839 --> 01:18:56,319
and you can tell someone else that you have seen it 

2469
01:18:56,319 --> 01:18:59,900
it's really a quick thing that can be useful for many organizations.

2473
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:04,500
So the sighting itself sounds like a very small feature

2474
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:10,399
but at the end, it's a an easy one for contributing and helping the others to know

2478
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:15,0
if an indicator is still valuable and so on, so sighting is really something that 

2481
01:19:15,0 --> 01:19:22,920
can basically be a kind of of entry-level things to do when sharing information 

2484
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:28,500
Something else that we have in MISP, this one is I think becoming more and more important

2487
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,239
and we will do a quick demo later regarding that.

2489
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:37,0
It's a timeline, i mean when we do analysis and so on,
 
2490
01:19:37,0 --> 01:19:40,0
it's really i would say common to have a first seen, last seen 

2492
01:19:40,0 --> 01:19:42,159
to see the evolution of things over time.

2494
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:45,198
In the example that you see on the screen there

2496
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:47,319
It's based on specific threat actors

2497
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:54,839
that sends a significant numbers of spear phishing 

2499
01:19:54,839 --> 01:20:00,0
and those spear phishing are very well known when we collect those timestamps and so on.

2503
01:20:00,0 --> 01:20:03,0
So you can really see and trace the evolution of a specific group and so on.

2506
01:20:03,0 --> 01:20:07,500
This can be done automatically, for example passive dns records

2507
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:13,0
I have very often the first seen, last seen and automatically you can really build

2510
01:20:13,0 --> 01:20:18,0
and create this kind of timeline because it can be really cumbersome if you have to do it manually

2514
01:20:18,0 --> 01:20:22,239
So we have a nice view like that so that means every time you set a first seen, last seen

2516
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:26,0
on any attribute, object, and so on; it automatically populate on the timeline

2518
01:20:26,0 --> 01:20:31,7
and it's an easy way to to see evolution, trend and so on for your analysis

2521
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:39,280
and this is a completely interactive so you can navigate over that.

2522
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,0
We will show that later.

2524
01:20:43,0 --> 01:20:47,39
So for life cycle management, again this is something that we show briefly but 

2527
01:20:47,39 --> 01:20:49,480
we're going to way more depth about that tomorrow 

2528
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:53,519
is basically here we see some examples of some attributes 

2531
01:20:53,519 --> 01:20:58,800
that have scores applied to them coming from different scoring models.

2532
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,0
So we see there an IDS simple decaying model and then a custom model 

2533
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:08,800
titled "Model 5" that are basically running on each of those indicators 

2535
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:13,500
and they generate a score taking into account for things such as labels that are attached to them,

2536
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,0
the timestamp on when the attribute was created 

2537
01:21:17,0 --> 01:21:21,0
as well as the timestamp of the different sightings that came in so generally

2544
01:21:21,0 --> 01:21:24,0
if something is still being actively seen in your network 

2545
01:21:24,0 --> 01:21:28,0
that is still relevant despite the indicator itself being perhaps older 

2546
01:21:28,0 --> 01:21:33,520
and then using the score that gets generated from these different models that you define

2551
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,500
you can basically then make those decisions when you're exporting data to only include

2554
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:43,0
data above a certain threshold when you're feeding your SIEM for example.

2556
01:21:44,79 --> 01:21:48,500
Yeah, and this one is quite interesting because you can really define 

2557
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:52,159
so the thing that is really important with the decaying of indicators

2559
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:58,920
you are not modifying that actually you are really just updating and overlapping 

2564
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,759
and you can just define those kind of models so that means for example

2566
01:22:01,759 --> 01:22:05,39
even within a team where you don't agree on a specific model, you can have both models.

2569
01:22:05,39 --> 01:22:09,679
It's very common, for example, to have models for intrusion detection systems

2571
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:16,719
and specific models for i don't know, endpoint, {inaudiable} or endpoint protection device

2574
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:20,639
and in MISP you have even a models or kind of simulator 

2575
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:25,500
where you can simulate the different model that you want to apply

2578
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,920
and to see what kind of lifetime you want to apply,

2579
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,0
when it decay, when for example you have a specific threshold where 

2582
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:39,500
basically say okay you don't use anymore those kind of data and you can do the mapping with 
 
2583
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:45,500
specific taxonomies you can with the different types, attributes, and so on

2585
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:49,0
directly in MISP and it is really a quick win.

2588
01:22:49,0 --> 01:22:53,500
So you are not bound, for example, we know that some TIPs for example 

2591
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:58,479
have a kind of system-wide decaying models in MISP it is not like that,

2593
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:02,679
everyone has their models, we are sharing some models 

2594
01:23:02,679 --> 01:23:06,0
and you can define what you want to use without really altering the data.

2598
01:23:06,0 --> 01:23:10,238
So that means this kind of of information there is just an overlay 

2599
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:15,0
and you actually keep your own data in the systems without having any modification.

2601
01:23:17,0 --> 01:23:24,0
And you can simulate that one.

2605
01:23:27,0 --> 01:23:31,0
So when it comes to starting out, one of the trickiest things obviously is 

2606
01:23:31,0 --> 01:23:34,0
when you're starting out with MISP is if you're staring as an empty instance 

2607
01:23:34,0 --> 01:23:37,198
then getting started and encoding information is really tough 

2610
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,0
because you don't know what is really expected from the communities out there, you don't know how.

2612
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:44,0
It's a new tool, you don't really know how to get started. 

2616
01:23:44,0 --> 01:23:50,239
So in order to ease this a little bit there are a bunch of different feeds some of those that we also provide ourselves

2619
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:54,500
which is obviously operational information something that you can use directly

2622
01:23:54,500 --> 01:24:00,799
so these are OSINT feeds that we produce as well from our TLP white data set 

2623
01:24:00,799 --> 01:24:04,0
and the idea is that this will really help with bootstrapping your processes.

2625
01:24:04,0 --> 01:24:08,0
Look at the data we consider that generally well-formed

2629
01:24:08,0 --> 01:24:12,500
and well contextualized. It should give you an idea of what data generally looks like in MISP.

2631
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,500
So don't start out with a fresh instance, 

2632
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,0
just go to your feed menu in your MISP when you're installing it

2633
01:24:18,0 --> 01:24:22,500
and pull in some of these OSINT feeds so that you see the information already.

2636
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,359
Also it's a great way to test your internal tooling 

2637
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:31,119
so if you want to test the APIs, if you want to test internal synchronization,

2640
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:33,500
it's good to have larger data set already from the get go 

2641
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:38,679
so that you already see that the movement of the data is working as expected.

2645
01:24:38,679 --> 01:24:44,500
Yeah, the other thing that you can do and where we're going to talk about that quite a bit tomorrow

2648
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:50,500
is basically figuring out which feeds are worth ingesting,

2650
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:55,719
how the feeds compare to each other, running overlap analysis between them and so on

2653
01:24:55,719 --> 01:25:00,0
So this is something that this is quite a heavy topic for tomorrow.

2656
01:25:05,0 --> 01:25:08,0
You're muted alex. 

2657
01:25:08,0 --> 01:25:09,500
Yeah just discover {inaudiable this/MISP}.

2658
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:12,0
So as you can see for MISP,

2659
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:15,300
it's the development of MISP already done over the years, 

2661
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:19,760
based on the feedback of users and that's really one of the key elements for us.

2663
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,0
We wanted a tool for us that works 

2665
01:25:22,0 --> 01:25:28,879
and it's key and based on that we wanted something that works for others too

2667
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:33,679
and i mean the tool is evolving over time so you see that we have plenty of functionalities

2670
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:37,79
On those two days of workshop we'll try to cover a part of it,

2672
01:25:37,79 --> 01:25:41,679
we had already some good questions regarding how to customize this and so on.

2675
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:45,119
We might give you some hints how to do it and and so on,

2677
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:47,0
so we won't be able to cover everything in those two days 

2678
01:25:47,0 --> 01:25:54,0
but you'll see that you can really update MISP based on your specific use cases and so on. 

2679
01:25:54,0 --> 01:26:00,500
So MISP is there as a tool, what really usually matters and are the successful,

2680
01:26:00,500--> 01:26:07,0
I would say, sharing communities depends on the practices or you do that and so on

2687
01:26:07,0 --> 01:26:11,0
and we really want at least at the end, even if it's a complex tool and so on 

2690
01:26:11,0 --> 01:26:15,520
to be as easy as possible for covering different use case 

2691
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,500
and that's really the thing that we want to do, 

2693
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,520
is for example for a lot of things that we have in MISP 

2694
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,700
and someone just asked the questions about how can you customize MISP

2697
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:27,119
a lot of things in MISP can be customized by just modifying some JSON files.

2700
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:32,519
It's the case for MISP objects so if you want to create a new object you just update the json files,

2701 
01:26:32,519 --> 01:26:39,500
if you want to, for example, create a new taxonomies or create a new galaxy 

2706
01:26:39,50 --> 01:26:41,839
you just create those kind of json files.

2708
01:26:41,839 --> 01:26:45,500
You have other ways to update and change the behavior of MISP.

2709
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,158
it's based for example on MISP modules

2710
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:51,439
so if you want to change the behavior of the expansion and so on

2712
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:58,800
you can just play with MISP modules and we will quickly show you some examples on these modules

2716
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,80
but that's really simple i mean there's no {inaudiable}

2719
01:27:02,80 --> 01:27:10,239
and that's the thing that you have to understand with MISP project is not just a small open source software somewhere

2720
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:16,800
it's really a set of combination of tool, software, packages, open standards,

2721
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:23,799
various best practices, shared knowledge base and obviously the community is using it.

2728
01:27:23,799 --> 01:27:26,500
So that's really the thing that we will have we love with FIRST for example. 

2731
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:31,0
it is to have this kind of community, learning together, sharing information,

2732
01:27:31,0 --> 01:27:33,119
and so that's that's really a key for us.

2735
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:41,500
We have, I think more than 500 contributors on the MISP project with even more nowadays.

2738
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:45,500
So if you want to become one of the contributors it's really straightforward i mean

2739
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:48,800
if you have something, a problem that you want to solve,

2742
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,400
for example on an object, you just do a pull request and

2743
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,840
it will be in MISP immediately and you become a contributor in the project 

2747
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:58,0
so really for us, it's really key in MISP 

2748
01:27:58,0 --> 01:28:02,0
is to have a kind of tool that is supporting the different use cases

2749
01:28:02,0 --> 01:28:06,238
Okay so before that, we do a break i will share you with you 

2750
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:12,759
some practical details on accessing the MISP training instance because there were some questions regarding that

2755
01:28:12,759 --> 01:28:20,0
and after the break, we will do the hands-on practical session 

2756
01:28:20,0 --> 01:28:25,359
with an example, so we will with a real example, so you will create the full event 

2757
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:27,359
based on some information that you receive.

2759
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:36,500
So first of all, I will give you some details about how to access the MISP instance.


2763
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:42,500
S0, first of all we have a {inaudiable acting/active} page 

2764
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:48,500
which I obviously share at some point in time and i will share it again.

2766
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:54,799
Yes. So there's a page with some pages that you can even edit.

2769
01:28:54,799 --> 01:29:00,0
I will paste the link again in the chat for everyone.

2772
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:11,319
That's the link, so we have a 50 account on the training instance. 

2773
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:14,159
Pick randomly one

2775
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:18,0
it doesn't matter if you are multiple one using the same account but be careful

2777
01:29:18,0 --> 01:29:22,119
don't change the password because maybe some people will complain,

2780
01:29:22,119 --> 01:29:30,800
and then we have a "TrainingFIRST2021" password so super simple

2782
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,600
not so secure but that's fine it's a training instance.

2785
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:41,0
Just for the reference, for the one that doesn't want to use the training instance

2786
01:29:41,0 --> 01:29:44,0
sometimes for whatever reason you want to use your own instance.

2788
01:29:44,0 --> 01:29:50,238
We have different images, virtual box and VMware images for MISP.

2791
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:54,158
So if you want to play with MISP locally and so on.

2793
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:57,279
If you want to play with synchronization too, you can even connect those two 

2794
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:05,280
So and during the sessions we will connect to that instance so the instant is "iglocska.eu"

2796
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:14,0
and when you connect, you will get access to the instance.

2799
01:30:14,0 --> 01:30:18,158
So you enter your training password so I will enter with my specific account

2802
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:23,500
and we will use that instance for the hands-on that we will do just after the break.

2804
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:31,0
So what i propose now is to do a 15 minute break and we start at 45, if it's fine for everyone

2808
01:30:31,0 --> 01:30:39,600
and we will start by with the practical sessions with a specific email

2811
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,600
that we will share in the {inaudiable} as a practical example

 2813
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:51,300 
so thank you for the one that join us now and we will start again at 45 

2814
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:54,500
to do the hands-on session. Thank you very much.

2817
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,500
Thank you.

TODO
2819
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:15,118
okay and shall we get started

2820
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:22,559
sure welcome back everyone

2821
01:44:20,79 --> 01:44:24,399
okay so now what we're going to be doing

2822
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,80
is we're going to look a little bit

2823
01:44:24,399 --> 01:44:27,679
at miss pizza so we've talked plenty

2824
01:44:26,79 --> 01:44:28,960
about it but we haven't actually done

2825
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:30,560
anything with it yet

2826
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:32,560
so i really encourage everyone that has

2827
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:35,199
a misfits to also play along

2828
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:36,800
and to create your own events what we're

2829
01:44:35,198 --> 01:44:37,439
going to be doing is we're going to go

2830
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:40,639
through as

2831
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:41,359
any fictional little exercise assume

2832
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:44,0
6280.639 --> 6284
that you

2833
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:44,799
that you receive an email from uh in

2834
01:44:44,0 --> 01:44:46,560
6284 --> 6286.56
this case

2835
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,840
luxembourg english telco this is certain

2836
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:52,80
of them describing an incident of a very

2837
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,520
simplistic incident

2838
01:44:52,79 --> 01:44:56,479
of what happened what we're going to be

2839
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:59,280
trying to do now is to model this a miss

2840
01:44:56,479 --> 01:45:00,839
and to explain how you can further

2841
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:02,800
improve it and contextualize this

2842
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:05,39
information

2843
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,239
so before we start uh once you're logged

2844
01:45:05,39 --> 01:45:08,639
into the

2845
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:09,678
into miss pinsons such as the hosted

2846
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:11,359
training instance

2847
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:13,840
this is what you're going to be seeing

2848
01:45:11,359 --> 01:45:15,198
so it's a it's a little bit squeezed on

2849
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:18,639
alex's screen

2850
01:45:15,198 --> 01:45:21,599
but the idea is that you have a list of

2851
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:23,279
events that are listed on the main page

2852
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:25,280
so we're in the event index this is our

2853
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:26,719
landing page when we load up misp

2854
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:28,79
and each of these individual lines

2855
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:30,158
represents an event so they're

2856
01:45:28,79 --> 01:45:33,519
describing either an attack

2857
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:34,960
or perhaps a report recurring

2858
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:38,800
distribution

2859
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:40,0
6334.96 --> 6340
or a certain type of of indicator lists

2860
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,600
and so on

2861
01:45:40,0 --> 01:45:43,439
6340 --> 6343.44
so what you're seeing here is you have

2862
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,679
each of these events having an id

2863
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:47,359
and some metadata around it so these are

2864
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:48,960
this metadata can be either coming from

2865
01:45:47,359 --> 01:45:50,719
this galaxy cluster

2866
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:52,639
system that we mentioned for example

2867
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:55,679
describing different

2868
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:56,880
attacker techniques the different types

2869
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:58,560
of

2870
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:00,560
ransomwares in this case or attack

2871
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,0
6358.56 --> 6362
patterns that are leveraged

2872
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,520
and then if we scroll a bit further

2873
01:46:02,0 --> 01:46:04,319
6362 --> 6364.32
right so this is a bit lower resolution

2874
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,800
there that we see

2875
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:07,920
but uh you should have it visible on the

2876
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:12,159
same page

2877
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:14,239
um you see the information about uh

2878
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:15,439
what this event is trying to describe to

2879
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:17,198
us

2880
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:19,599
it's simple to understand text-based

2881
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:21,198
representation now this instance is used

2882
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,719
for trainings in general so it's going

2883
01:46:21,198 --> 01:46:24,559
to be filled with a lot of junk

2884
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:27,39
interspersed with real data that is

2885
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:28,800
coming from our tlp wide feed

2886
01:46:27,39 --> 01:46:31,679
so you're going to see some obviously

2887
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:33,840
weird events in there

2888
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:35,840
these are just there for testing just

2889
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:37,199
players playing during an exercise and

2890
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:40,159
so on

2891
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:41,439
but also some real events there so what

2892
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:43,118
we're going to be doing now is we're

2893
01:46:41,439 --> 01:46:44,879
going to create our own event based on

2894
01:46:43,118 --> 01:46:45,759
that email that we received it's also on

2895
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:47,600
the hackamd

2896
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,880
page so just have a look at email

2897
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,119
exactly

2898
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:52,239
and we need to start encoding with that

2899
01:46:51,118 --> 01:46:54,319
event

2900
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:55,839
so before we include anything in misp

2901
01:46:54,319 --> 01:46:57,920
the first thing that we need to do

2902
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:00,239
is we need to create a new event so this

2903
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,399
is where everything starts

2904
01:47:00,238 --> 01:47:04,238
way to do it is to just click on add

2905
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:05,359
event on the left side of the menu

2906
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:07,359
and then you start with a very

2907
01:47:05,359 --> 01:47:11,198
simplistic form that where we can

2908
01:47:07,359 --> 01:47:13,679
describe the event in a very high level

2909
01:47:11,198 --> 01:47:15,118
so here you see it's it's the first step

2910
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:16,399
is very straightforward

2911
01:47:15,118 --> 01:47:17,920
the import the things that we have to

2912
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:18,479
watch out for or here is we already

2913
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,239
decide

2914
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:22,638
who gets to see the event so this is the

2915
01:47:20,238 --> 01:47:23,279
distribution level and that we need to

2916
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:25,520
set and

2917
01:47:23,279 --> 01:47:27,599
basically a basic description of it as

2918
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:30,159
for the distribution itself

2919
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:32,159
you have different uh ways of

2920
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:33,679
interacting with the data here already

2921
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:35,359
so one of the decisions that you have to

2922
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:35,760
make even if you're going to share to

2923
01:47:35,359 --> 01:47:37,759
the

2924
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:40,0
6455.76 --> 6460
wider community out there is do i keep

2925
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:41,119
this internal until i'm ready to share

2926
01:47:40,0 --> 01:47:43,118
6460 --> 6463.119
it with the community

2927
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:44,719
or do i already make it visible to

2928
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:46,559
anyone that has access to the data in

2929
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:48,960
the community

2930
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:50,800
now keep in mind that we have a

2931
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,79
publishing process in misp so until an

2932
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,320
event is published

2933
01:47:52,79 --> 01:47:55,118
it is not propagated out to other missed

2934
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:56,639
instances

2935
01:47:55,118 --> 01:47:58,158
that means anyone on the current miss

2936
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:59,679
pencils can see the data

2937
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:02,0
6478.159 --> 6482
but it will not jump to a different

2938
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:04,319
misspen since at this point in any way

2939
01:48:02,0 --> 01:48:05,439
6482 --> 6485.44
but if you if you're creating it on a

2940
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:07,679
hosted instance

2941
01:48:05,439 --> 01:48:08,799
for example if you if your isak is

2942
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:10,319
running a miss pinstance and you're

2943
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,840
creating it on that one directly

2944
01:48:10,319 --> 01:48:14,0
6490.32 --> 6494
then this already has an impact on who

2945
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,400
can see the data

2946
01:48:14,0 --> 01:48:18,0
6494 --> 6498
so the option here either go with your

2947
01:48:16,399 --> 01:48:19,519
organization only and then

2948
01:48:18,0 --> 01:48:21,679
6498 --> 6501.679
raise the distribution level once it's

2949
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:23,840
ready to be released or you already

2950
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:25,440
involve addressing the process and you

2951
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,279
pick something like community only where

2952
01:48:25,439 --> 01:48:28,319
others can chip in with their ideas from

2953
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:30,960
the get-go

2954
01:48:28,319 --> 01:48:32,559
so this is up to you it's a risk versus

2955
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,719
efficiency question

2956
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:35,600
do i want to share the information and

2957
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:37,760
potentially

2958
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,199
overshare a bit by including by

2959
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,960
accidentally uploading information that

2960
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:43,198
is not yet

2961
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:45,679
confirmed that it can be shared out

2962
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:47,439
versus losing out on perhaps others

2963
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:49,118
immediately jumping on board and saying

2964
01:48:47,439 --> 01:48:50,399
okay this is also something we've seen

2965
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:51,599
we've already done the analysis of it

2966
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:53,599
here you go

2967
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,960
so you have to balance those two things

2968
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:59,39
out so let's start

2969
01:48:54,960 --> 01:49:01,920
no for example for example what

2970
01:48:59,39 --> 01:49:03,359
you have is when people are working on a

2971
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:06,960
case by default they say

2972
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:08,79
it's organization and at one point in

2973
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,79
time

2974
01:49:08,79 --> 01:49:11,840
the team lead for example decide at some

2975
01:49:10,79 --> 01:49:13,359
point it's okay no you can share it

2976
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:16,239
to a wider community and then you change

2977
01:49:13,359 --> 01:49:17,839
the distribution level

2978
01:49:16,238 --> 01:49:19,519
yeah indeed so let's start with the

2979
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:20,800
organization only for now uh

2980
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:22,560
for different reasons that we'll get

2981
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,0
6560.8 --> 6564
back to later on it allows us to show

2982
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,119
off another feature afterwards that is

2983
01:49:24,0 --> 01:49:26,800
6564 --> 6566.8
handy

2984
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:28,639
so we start with that then we have to

2985
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:29,199
describe this the threat level so this

2986
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:31,840
is

2987
01:49:29,198 --> 01:49:33,598
a very subjective question uh threat

2988
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,800
level will depend a lot on what sort of

2989
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:36,560
an organization you are

2990
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:38,0
6574.8 --> 6578
versus who you're sharing it with so we

2991
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:40,400
all have different interpretations of

2992
01:49:38,0 --> 01:49:41,760
6578 --> 6581.76
what we consider a high threat level

2993
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:43,679
we have some descriptions for each of

2994
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,520
these fields uh

2995
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:46,800
predefined if you click on the little

2996
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,199
information box

2997
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:51,520
it will tell you that hi is uh

2998
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:53,519
sophisticated apt malware or zero day

2999
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:55,40
attack

3000
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:57,599
please just freely disregard this

3001
01:49:55,39 --> 01:49:58,479
because nowadays a lot of information

3002
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:00,159
sharing

3003
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:02,79
happens in completely different domains

3004
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:03,598
so if a fraud team is sharing

3005
01:50:02,79 --> 01:50:06,880
information about

3006
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:08,400
fraudster their definition of high

3007
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,719
threat level would be very different

3008
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:11,439
from

3009
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:13,198
those in cyber security for example so

3010
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:15,519
generally it's just a subjective

3011
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:17,198
first measure but a lot of organizations

3012
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:19,40
users use this to briefly filter out

3013
01:50:17,198 --> 01:50:21,439
what they should tackle first

3014
01:50:19,39 --> 01:50:22,960
so still use it with care if you don't

3015
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:25,759
want to use this field

3016
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:27,679
picking undefined is fine too analysis

3017
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:30,560
the next field describes how far along

3018
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:33,39
you've come with the analysis process

3019
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:34,480
so basically uh with this what you're

3020
01:50:33,39 --> 01:50:36,158
telling the communities i'm just

3021
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:39,118
starting out with the analysis

3022
01:50:36,158 --> 01:50:40,719
these are my initial findings versus for

3023
01:50:39,118 --> 01:50:41,839
example saying that my analysis process

3024
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:44,960
is already complete

3025
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:48,0
6641.84 --> 6648
i'm not going to be digging more for now

3026
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:50,840
i consider this complete if you have

3027
01:50:48,0 --> 01:50:54,960
6648 --> 6654.96
additional information then obviously

3028
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:56,880
uh already start collaborating with us

3029
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:58,399
so just pick whichever is most

3030
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,840
appropriate for you let's just go with

3031
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:01,679
initial for now

3032
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:04,159
and then comes the most important part

3033
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:06,319
of this form which is

3034
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:08,319
describing the event info so this is a

3035
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:10,158
brief description for analysts that are

3036
01:51:08,319 --> 01:51:12,79
looking at the data that describe

3037
01:51:10,158 --> 01:51:13,198
the best described the event that you're

3038
01:51:12,79 --> 01:51:16,719
basically uh

3039
01:51:13,198 --> 01:51:17,678
sharing now be brief here and be careful

3040
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:20,480
about

3041
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:22,639
including very domain or organization

3042
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:23,279
specific information one of the mistakes

3043
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:25,279
that

3044
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:26,319
that people often make here is for

3045
01:51:25,279 --> 01:51:29,359
example uh

3046
01:51:26,319 --> 01:51:30,479
typing a ticket number or ticket id in

3047
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:32,158
there

3048
01:51:30,479 --> 01:51:33,759
so if you have a ticketing system and

3049
01:51:32,158 --> 01:51:35,198
you basically start your investigation

3050
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,800
from your ticketing system

3051
01:51:35,198 --> 01:51:38,719
sharing out something like what alex has

3052
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:40,239
typed there is not very handy for anyone

3053
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:41,679
else nobody will have a clue what you

3054
01:51:40,238 --> 01:51:43,198
mean with that

3055
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:44,639
another mistake that can happen here

3056
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:46,0
6703.199 --> 6706
very often is especially if you're

3057
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:47,840
starting out small and

3058
01:51:46,0 --> 01:51:49,760
6706 --> 6709.76
in turn initially you're only keeping

3059
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:51,520
the events for yourself

3060
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:53,760
and then perhaps later on you decide

3061
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:56,159
that you want to maybe perhaps

3062
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,520
after all share it out to a community

3063
01:51:56,158 --> 01:51:58,960
then one of the things that can really

3064
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,719
hurt you at that point is if you've

3065
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,319
used different language for example to

3066
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:03,520
describe the event info so we've seen

3067
01:52:02,319 --> 01:52:06,639
this very often

3068
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:07,360
we instead of describing the things in

3069
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,480
english we

3070
01:52:07,359 --> 01:52:10,479
choose our own languages

3071
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:18,79
and myself is hungarian we are we're

3072
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:21,599
pretty prone to doing this

3073
01:52:18,79 --> 01:52:22,639
in general uh and this is generally

3074
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:24,400
something that will hurt us

3075
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:25,920
in the long term because uh once you

3076
01:52:24,399 --> 01:52:28,399
share it out with a more

3077
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:30,79
international community you either have

3078
01:52:28,399 --> 01:52:32,799
to go through the effort of translating

3079
01:52:30,79 --> 01:52:34,399
it or basically make it illegible for

3080
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:36,800
the recipient

3081
01:52:34,399 --> 01:52:37,839
so stick to something simple simple

3082
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:41,199
phrasing

3083
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:45,840
be as concise as possible

3084
01:52:41,198 --> 01:52:45,839
but make sure that it's still understood

3085
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,440
we know that it's targeting the telco

3086
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:57,198
sector in luxembourg and we know that we

3087
01:52:55,439 --> 01:52:57,598
have a malware sample so that's a pretty

3088
01:52:57,198 --> 01:52:59,598
nice

3089
01:52:57,599 --> 01:53:01,39
short explanation of what the event is

3090
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:02,560
about

3091
01:53:01,39 --> 01:53:04,800
so once we click submit we have our

3092
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:06,480
event created and we already see that

3093
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:08,400
that our event suddenly has a lot of

3094
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:09,39
data that we didn't intentionally put in

3095
01:53:08,399 --> 01:53:11,39
there yet

3096
01:53:09,39 --> 01:53:13,359
so we see a bunch of tags that are

3097
01:53:11,39 --> 01:53:15,840
applied to the event we see that

3098
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:16,799
the event already has information about

3099
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:18,639
uh

3100
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,0
6796.8 --> 6800
who created the information who the

3101
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:22,0
6798.639 --> 6802
local owners and

3102
01:53:20,0 --> 01:53:24,238
6800 --> 6804.239
information and so on so this basically

3103
01:53:22,0 --> 01:53:25,439
6802 --> 6805.44
takes a lot of local settings from uh

3104
01:53:24,238 --> 01:53:27,519
from the instance

3105
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:28,960
and it uses the event when it is created

3106
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:31,199
with these basic datasets

3107
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:33,439
a lot of these also involve the

3108
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:35,118
contextualization that we start out with

3109
01:53:33,439 --> 01:53:36,559
so it might seem a little bit pointless

3110
01:53:35,118 --> 01:53:38,479
to immediately

3111
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,0
6816.56 --> 6820
label something that we have not even

3112
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:42,79
started working on yet

3113
01:53:40,0 --> 01:53:43,359
6820 --> 6823.36
but also keep in mind that very often

3114
01:53:42,79 --> 01:53:45,118
what we do internally in our

3115
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:46,79
organizations is we have several missed

3116
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:49,359
instances

3117
01:53:46,79 --> 01:53:51,198
that are uh that already are domain

3118
01:53:49,359 --> 01:53:52,799
specific so for example we have our spam

3119
01:53:51,198 --> 01:53:56,0
6831.199 --> 6836
collector instance we have our

3120
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:58,639
our sandboxing ignis vincents and so on

3121
01:53:56,0 --> 01:54:00,479
6836 --> 6840.48
these these already are uh define the

3122
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:00,960
scope of the information that go into

3123
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:02,879
them

3124
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,960
so we can already decide okay if we if

3125
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,599
we are on our spam collector miss

3126
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:07,279
vincent

3127
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:08,880
anything that goes in there will be

3128
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:10,719
related to spam so in this case we can

3129
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:12,159
remove these tags because we don't

3130
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,880
we don't actually want to include those

3131
01:54:12,158 --> 01:54:15,679
just yet maybe we can keep that one

3132
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:17,520
because it's still

3133
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:20,319
a draft so that means we will do an

3134
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:23,599
evaluation of this famous email accuracy

3135
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:24,238
and then um so we have some defined

3136
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:25,920
taxonomy

3137
01:54:24,238 --> 01:54:27,439
misplan on this instance we enabled for

3138
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:29,520
example the workflow one

3139
01:54:27,439 --> 01:54:31,39
uh this one is maybe of interest from

3140
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:33,280
different organizations is

3141
01:54:31,39 --> 01:54:35,599
a generic one about workflow uh what is

3142
01:54:33,279 --> 01:54:37,920
the current state or other thing so

3143
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:39,279
don't forget uh in the initial event

3144
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,560
when we created the event we have

3145
01:54:39,279 --> 01:54:42,960
information about

3146
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:44,639
uh the state and stuff like that now

3147
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,158
with this what we do is recommend to

3148
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:46,880
have taxonomies and you can you can

3149
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:49,359
really

3150
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:51,440
set up whatever you like and in the misp

3151
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:52,319
event to define the current state of

3152
01:54:51,439 --> 01:54:55,839
this event

3153
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:55,840
so we keep draft from this case

3154
01:54:57,39 --> 01:55:01,840
yeah indeed so we keep it at this and we

3155
01:55:00,238 --> 01:55:03,598
scroll further down and we see that miss

3156
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:05,119
warns us about a few things first of all

3157
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:06,639
data is not published

3158
01:55:05,118 --> 01:55:08,639
and second of all if we scroll a bit

3159
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:10,239
further down we see that mispo also

3160
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:11,920
tells us that there are no attributes in

3161
01:55:10,238 --> 01:55:12,399
here so this is still an empty envelope

3162
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:14,319
that we

3163
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:15,519
are about to share so list tells us

3164
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:18,719
don't share this just yet

3165
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:19,119
fill it up with data first so at this

3166
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,319
point

3167
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:26,0
6919.119 --> 6926
we can start populating the information

3168
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:26,0
6922.32 --> 6926
so if you if you look at the

3169
01:55:27,439 --> 01:55:31,919
initial document that we that we use as

3170
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,800
a starting point we see in there that we

3171
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:35,760
have a lot of

3172
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,679
information in there described we see

3173
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:38,400
for example that we are dealing with

3174
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:40,319
spearfishing

3175
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:41,598
we see that we have an email that was

3176
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:44,880
received at a certain

3177
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:47,199
point in time and we also see that

3178
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:48,319
we have an attacker that pretends to be

3179
01:55:47,198 --> 01:55:51,678
um

3180
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:54,0
6948.32 --> 6954
working at the ceo's uh uh daughter

3181
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:55,440
and sending the email address from

3182
01:55:54,0 --> 01:55:57,198
6954 --> 6957.199
spoofed uh

3183
01:55:55,439 --> 01:55:59,359
the email from a spoofed email address

3184
01:55:57,198 --> 01:56:00,719
so we can start by by describing this

3185
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:01,759
information by including this

3186
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:03,279
information

3187
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:04,800
so perhaps one of the things that we can

3188
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:06,880
take here is let's start with the most

3189
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:09,119
basic thing we're describing an email

3190
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,880
so let's start with an email object so

3191
01:56:09,118 --> 01:56:15,839
we're going to add an object

3192
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:15,840
and we're going to select email

3193
01:56:18,479 --> 01:56:22,479
so here we see that this is coming from

3194
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:26,400
the templating system where you can

3195
01:56:22,479 --> 01:56:28,79
define uh pre different concepts with

3196
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:30,79
different fields that have to be then

3197
01:56:28,79 --> 01:56:31,760
populated using this object templating

3198
01:56:30,79 --> 01:56:33,359
system

3199
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:35,440
so we have a bunch of information that

3200
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:37,39
we can fill out here we see the spoofed

3201
01:56:35,439 --> 01:56:43,839
address so we see a from address that we

3202
01:56:37,39 --> 01:56:43,840
can encode

3203
01:56:45,439 --> 01:56:52,879
okay we also have um

3204
01:56:50,399 --> 01:56:55,118
a sample that i don't know if you if

3205
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:58,960
i've uploaded anywhere alex if not just

3206
01:56:55,118 --> 01:57:00,880
pick any file for now because

3207
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:02,319
i think that's something i forgot to do

3208
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:03,679
yeah i don't know where the sample is

3209
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:06,719
yeah maybe we should add it

3210
01:57:03,679 --> 01:57:11,840
yeah just put putty dot x or something

3211
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:11,840
if you have it

3212
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,119
oops

3213
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:19,599
or we can do it as a separate object we

3214
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:21,39
can we can just do this separately yeah

3215
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:24,400
we can do a separate objective

3216
01:57:21,39 --> 01:57:25,118
yeah indeed indeed okay so what we can

3217
01:57:24,399 --> 01:57:27,118
already

3218
01:57:25,118 --> 01:57:28,238
describe here is we can we can still add

3219
01:57:27,118 --> 01:57:31,839
the name of the

3220
01:57:28,238 --> 01:57:34,158
uh attachment that we had in there

3221
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:34,159
um

3222
01:57:35,359 --> 01:57:39,839
just to fast track it a bit

3223
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:42,880
good

3224
01:57:46,79 --> 01:57:49,760
so we have a timestamp too which is

3225
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:52,319
interesting so um

3226
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:54,239
this one has been received as a specific

3227
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:56,639
so it was a third

3228
01:57:54,238 --> 01:57:58,479
of so the first scene is basically

3229
01:57:56,639 --> 01:58:03,440
something that you can you can really uh

3230
01:57:58,479 --> 01:58:03,439
set up so it was the third of february

3231
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:10,158
we had a specific time if i'm misleading

3232
01:58:07,198 --> 01:58:11,39
um so in this one we have uh this one

3233
01:58:10,158 --> 01:58:14,349
has been

3234
01:58:11,39 --> 01:58:16,880
sent on received on

3235
01:58:14,350 --> 01:58:21,840
[Music]

3236
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:21,840
16 so i can

3237
01:58:27,439 --> 01:58:34,158
we also see that that basically

3238
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:37,199
the attachment was spoofing

3239
01:58:34,158 --> 01:58:39,598
the document uh

3240
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:40,638
about the report about the ceo's

3241
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:42,719
daughter's

3242
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:44,79
progress in school so we can pick the

3243
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:47,279
file name for the

3244
01:58:44,79 --> 01:58:50,639
uh attachment and that is under the

3245
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:50,639
attachment section in the object

3246
01:58:54,560 --> 01:59:01,199
good i'm just clicking it

3247
01:58:58,158 --> 01:59:02,960
yeah it is called report.x attacks i

3248
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:04,319
mean maybe it's not in the text right

3249
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:06,639
now okay it might not be in the text

3250
01:59:04,319 --> 01:59:12,319
might be just the original file

3251
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:12,319
about that so yeah report.x dot x

3252
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,360
attachment

3253
01:59:21,198 --> 01:59:24,879
and then we also know that it was

3254
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:24,879
received

3255
01:59:25,39 --> 01:59:28,800
that we have received header ip so we

3256
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:29,198
can include that as well that's also in

3257
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:33,440
the

3258
01:59:29,198 --> 01:59:33,439
stated email it's 137.221

3259
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:44,639
and we even have the hostname if you

3260
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:47,198
want to include that that was also

3261
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:47,199
included in

3262
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,679
or in the report

3263
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,679
perfect so this is as you can see here

3264
01:59:58,79 --> 02:00:01,198
we did not fill everything out because

3265
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:03,118
we don't know everything based on the

3266
02:00:01,198 --> 02:00:04,158
report but we knew some of the fields we

3267
02:00:03,118 --> 02:00:05,839
also see that

3268
02:00:04,158 --> 02:00:07,839
each of these objects basically have

3269
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:08,639
some requirements and we satisfy those

3270
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,560
in this case

3271
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:12,239
so if you scroll all the way to the top

3272
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:12,880
you will see that that this object had a

3273
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:14,559
requirement

3274
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:16,0
7212.88 --> 7216
any of those fields have to be filled

3275
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:18,80
we've definitely met that

3276
02:00:16,0 --> 02:00:21,359
7216 --> 7221.36
so we can just click submit and we can

3277
02:00:18,79 --> 02:00:21,359
create our object in this case

3278
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:26,799
so here we see mrs telling us if we

3279
02:00:25,359 --> 02:00:27,519
create this object that's what it will

3280
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,880
look like

3281
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:30,719
so we have in this case created our

3282
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:31,359
object and now it is attached to the

3283
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:33,840
event and

3284
02:00:31,359 --> 02:00:34,960
suddenly stuff happened here so we see

3285
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:37,119
that each of these

3286
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:38,480
attributes already start correlating

3287
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:40,799
with existing events

3288
02:00:38,479 --> 02:00:42,718
now we read this uh this little exercise

3289
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:44,159
before we didn't correlate with some of

3290
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:46,880
those previous events

3291
02:00:44,158 --> 02:00:50,238
but normally uh if this was a real case

3292
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:50,239
if you get a correlation

3293
02:00:50,319 --> 02:00:54,399
that is either something very similar

3294
02:00:52,319 --> 02:00:56,639
that already happened before or is it

3295
02:00:54,399 --> 02:00:58,719
something that simply

3296
02:00:56,639 --> 02:01:00,400
might be a coincidence but it's still

3297
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:02,239
close for investigation

3298
02:01:00,399 --> 02:01:04,559
to check is this something that might

3299
02:01:02,238 --> 02:01:07,439
help me bootstrap my investigation

3300
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:08,719
or is it just noise that is not maybe a

3301
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:09,279
side note because we have often the

3302
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:12,560
questions

3303
02:01:09,279 --> 02:01:14,319
um when you create such object in

3304
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,840
you see that can be cumbersome to create

3305
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:17,439
it manually

3306
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:20,79
so don't forget that everything that we

3307
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:22,479
do right now can be done through the api

3308
02:01:20,79 --> 02:01:23,519
so you can use pymisp automatically do

3309
02:01:22,479 --> 02:01:26,319
it and so on so

3310
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:27,840
what we show there um i think if you

3311
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:29,599
think on the api level

3312
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:31,119
it can be done automatically so if you

3313
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:33,119
have two that are extracting emails

3314
02:01:31,118 --> 02:01:35,39
automatically from the

3315
02:01:33,118 --> 02:01:36,559
pc mailbox whatever you can

3316
02:01:35,39 --> 02:01:37,760
automatically do it in mist

3317
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:39,679
we just show the complete process

3318
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:41,39
manually but you can never mix things

3319
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:42,399
for some event

3320
02:01:41,39 --> 02:01:44,158
maybe some might be created

3321
02:01:42,399 --> 02:01:46,638
automatically and then update it

3322
02:01:44,158 --> 02:01:47,839
manually and so on

3323
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:49,520
something else that might be interesting

3324
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:50,960
here at this point is we've encoded this

3325
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:54,560
object and we look at it

3326
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:56,880
and perhaps we we might want to

3327
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:58,400
to change the distribution settings

3328
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:59,279
based on the different data points that

3329
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:02,238
we have in there

3330
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:04,79
so most of these such as the malicious

3331
02:02:02,238 --> 02:02:05,759
host that email is sent from

3332
02:02:04,79 --> 02:02:07,279
are technical information that we can

3333
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:10,320
share with the broader community

3334
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:12,399
but perhaps the name of the

3335
02:02:10,319 --> 02:02:13,599
school that our ceo's daughter attends

3336
02:02:12,399 --> 02:02:15,118
is something that we don't need to share

3337
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:17,679
with the entire community

3338
02:02:15,118 --> 02:02:20,0
7335.119 --> 7340
so we could reduce the distribution of

3339
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:21,760
that individual attribute in this object

3340
02:02:20,0 --> 02:02:23,520
7340 --> 7343.52
so that we keep that for example only

3341
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:24,639
for our own organization and for our own

3342
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:26,0
7343.52 --> 7346
internal records

3343
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:27,599
so one of the things you can do in this

3344
02:02:26,0 --> 02:02:28,158
7346 --> 7348.159
case is you can edit that individual

3345
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:32,960
attribute

3346
02:02:28,158 --> 02:02:34,799
so the from address in the object

3347
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:36,399
and you can set a distribution level to

3348
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:38,560
your organization only

3349
02:02:36,399 --> 02:02:40,479
in this case once we release the uh the

3350
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:43,440
event to a broader audience

3351
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:45,198
it will keep this individual attribute

3352
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:46,0
7363.44 --> 7366
for an organization and it will not

3353
02:02:45,198 --> 02:02:49,598
share it out with

3354
02:02:46,0 --> 02:02:51,279
7366 --> 7371.28
uh with other constituencies okay

3355
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:53,39
so some other stuff that happened at

3356
02:02:51,279 --> 02:02:54,479
this point we see that

3357
02:02:53,39 --> 02:02:55,679
several of you are creating events so

3358
02:02:54,479 --> 02:02:57,359
that's great the correlation account

3359
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:59,440
really went up all of the sudden

3360
02:02:57,359 --> 02:03:00,479
so it's good to see something else that

3361
02:02:59,439 --> 02:03:03,439
happened at this point

3362
02:03:00,479 --> 02:03:05,198
is uh is the event itself got correlated

3363
02:03:03,439 --> 02:03:06,158
to other events as well so if you scroll

3364
02:03:05,198 --> 02:03:07,598
up all the way

3365
02:03:06,158 --> 02:03:09,519
we see that the attributes that we've

3366
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:11,360
added are also showing us what other

3367
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:12,159
events we're correlating in so this is a

3368
02:03:11,359 --> 02:03:13,598
summary of

3369
02:03:12,158 --> 02:03:15,359
all the individual attributes

3370
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:17,119
correlations from the event

3371
02:03:15,359 --> 02:03:18,639
that means that if you have if this

3372
02:03:17,118 --> 02:03:20,79
object is correlating or

3373
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:21,920
these attributes within the object are

3374
02:03:20,79 --> 02:03:23,840
correlating to it with a certain event

3375
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,359
and certain other objects are

3376
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:27,119
correlating with other events

3377
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:29,359
then this would be a full summary of all

3378
02:03:27,118 --> 02:03:31,920
the events that you're correlating with

3379
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:33,198
you can also draw a graph out of that if

3380
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:35,199
you click on the correlation graph you

3381
02:03:33,198 --> 02:03:37,118
will see how the events are interlinked

3382
02:03:35,198 --> 02:03:38,719
and you can further explore this by

3383
02:03:37,118 --> 02:03:41,519
selecting any of the notes

3384
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:42,639
and pressing x on that to further expand

3385
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:46,159
it with

3386
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:46,159
with it with its own correlations

3387
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:52,78
okay let's go back to event

3388
02:03:52,238 --> 02:03:56,399
yeah i don't think we have a lot of

3389
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:58,399
correlations

3390
02:03:56,399 --> 02:03:59,679
there for the other events they're all

3391
02:03:58,399 --> 02:04:02,960
the same

3392
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:03,920
uh okay now going back to a little

3393
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:06,319
example uh

3394
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:07,440
we have now created four attributes all

3395
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:10,319
together out of

3396
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:11,759
uh of the object template but we could

3397
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:12,880
have done this differently as well what

3398
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:14,800
we could have done

3399
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:16,480
is we could also have created those

3400
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:17,39
attributes individually and added those

3401
02:04:16,479 --> 02:04:20,319
to the

3402
02:04:17,39 --> 02:04:21,920
uh to the um event directly

3403
02:04:20,319 --> 02:04:24,319
so one of the things that we can do now

3404
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:25,920
is we can go back to our report and

3405
02:04:24,319 --> 02:04:27,359
tackle the next thing that is described

3406
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:28,480
there and let's do it slightly

3407
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:31,198
differently

3408
02:04:28,479 --> 02:04:31,759
so we also see that basically uh the

3409
02:04:31,198 --> 02:04:34,479
person

3410
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:36,840
uh that this is impersonated is also

3411
02:04:34,479 --> 02:04:40,959
described so that is basically

3412
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:40,960
um in this case

3413
02:04:41,118 --> 02:04:45,359
john doe the teacher of the student so

3414
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:47,40
let's just create a personal object and

3415
02:04:45,359 --> 02:04:50,78
describe that

3416
02:04:47,39 --> 02:04:53,519
so what we can do now is instead of

3417
02:04:50,78 --> 02:04:54,158
directly describing it as an object we

3418
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:57,520
can first

3419
02:04:54,158 --> 02:04:58,78
add those different fields at least a

3420
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:00,0
7497.52 --> 7500
name

3421
02:04:58,78 --> 02:05:01,599
as individual attributes so let's let's

3422
02:05:00,0 --> 02:05:03,279
7500 --> 7503.28
see how adding individual attributes

3423
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:05,39
work so we click on the little plus icon

3424
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:08,880
above the attribute list

3425
02:05:05,39 --> 02:05:08,880
and we simply select category person

3426
02:05:09,439 --> 02:05:13,598
and from person we select first name

3427
02:05:11,439 --> 02:05:15,39
first name is john

3428
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:17,39
and here we can already define is this

3429
02:05:15,39 --> 02:05:19,198
an indicator do we want to

3430
02:05:17,39 --> 02:05:21,599
set the for intrusion detection system

3431
02:05:19,198 --> 02:05:22,879
flag no definitely not this in itself is

3432
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:24,880
not an indicator

3433
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:26,719
in fact we want to also disable

3434
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:27,679
correlation on this as this is a pretty

3435
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:31,840
common

3436
02:05:27,679 --> 02:05:34,719
uh name that is definitely not something

3437
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:36,0
7531.84 --> 7536
to we don't need a comment for enough

3438
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:38,800
but now we're going to convert it into

3439
02:05:36,0 --> 02:05:41,439
7536 --> 7541.44
an object anyway

3440
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:42,880
uh so what we can do is we can also

3441
02:05:41,439 --> 02:05:44,158
disable correlation on this we don't

3442
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:47,520
want to correlate on john

3443
02:05:44,158 --> 02:05:51,39
okay okay doesn't matter

3444
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:53,360
actually we can do it uh

3445
02:05:51,39 --> 02:05:55,279
the same thing for the last name though

3446
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:57,198
and we can basically say that this is

3447
02:05:55,279 --> 02:05:58,960
now

3448
02:05:57,198 --> 02:06:00,399
last name now we've added these two

3449
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:01,599
things in there now the problem with

3450
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:03,679
this is if we just had

3451
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:04,719
attributes instead of objects is we

3452
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:06,399
don't really see that

3453
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:08,78
john and do in this case are the first

3454
02:06:06,399 --> 02:06:10,559
name and last name belong together

3455
02:06:08,78 --> 02:06:12,238
so if i were to describe several people

3456
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,599
in the same event you would have a list

3457
02:06:12,238 --> 02:06:17,118
of first names and a list of

3458
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:17,520
last names with no connection between

3459
02:06:17,118 --> 02:06:20,399
the

3460
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:21,920
two things so it's better to use objects

3461
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:24,399
in general whenever you're describing

3462
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:26,158
multiple aspects of the same thing

3463
02:06:24,399 --> 02:06:27,920
obviously if you just have a list of

3464
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:29,359
file hashes that you got from a feed and

3465
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:30,719
you just encode those and you don't have

3466
02:06:29,359 --> 02:06:32,0
7589.36 --> 7592
any other information with them you

3467
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:33,279
might as well just create flat

3468
02:06:32,0 --> 02:06:34,479
7592 --> 7594.48
attributes out of them

3469
02:06:33,279 --> 02:06:36,880
because there is nothing else to

3470
02:06:34,479 --> 02:06:38,399
describe from your perspective

3471
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:39,679
but even in that case it's arguable

3472
02:06:38,399 --> 02:06:40,799
whether you don't want to start an

3473
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:42,399
object

3474
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:44,0
7600.8 --> 7604
from the get go but what we can do in

3475
02:06:42,399 --> 02:06:45,598
this case if we did start with this way

3476
02:06:44,0 --> 02:06:47,520
7604 --> 7607.52
or if you receive information in this

3477
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:48,719
format or your tools parse the data out

3478
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:50,560
in this format is

3479
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:51,920
you can select those two attributes by

3480
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:52,960
clicking the little check marks next

3481
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:54,800
there are little

3482
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:56,560
tick boxes next to them and then

3483
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:58,79
clicking on group selected attributes

3484
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:59,920
into an object

3485
02:06:58,78 --> 02:07:01,599
and here miss will propose okay these

3486
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:03,440
are the different object templates that

3487
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:04,719
satisfy

3488
02:07:03,439 --> 02:07:06,960
the list of attributes that you've

3489
02:07:04,719 --> 02:07:07,920
selected there's a person object that we

3490
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:11,118
can use so let's

3491
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:11,118
just pick that one for now

3492
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:15,199
so here we see if we were to combine

3493
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:16,800
these two things they would be merged

3494
02:07:15,198 --> 02:07:19,198
into an object

3495
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:20,560
uh that is fine with us we see first

3496
02:07:19,198 --> 02:07:23,359
name will become

3497
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:24,480
the the first name of the object last

3498
02:07:23,359 --> 02:07:27,839
name the last name

3499
02:07:24,479 --> 02:07:27,839
so let's merge it

3500
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:34,239
now we basically have a personality now

3501
02:07:32,238 --> 02:07:36,718
we also know that this person that we're

3502
02:07:34,238 --> 02:07:38,638
dealing with here is impersonating uh

3503
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:40,560
the teacher of the ceo's or daughter so

3504
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:42,400
the same person impersonated person is a

3505
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:44,480
teacher of the of the ceo's author

3506
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:45,679
so we added the object and we also see

3507
02:07:44,479 --> 02:07:48,78
that there is a um

3508
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:50,239
that we can add just another text field

3509
02:07:48,78 --> 02:07:53,439
yeah just text field works

3510
02:07:50,238 --> 02:07:54,879
where we can describe it i just want to

3511
02:07:53,439 --> 02:07:57,598
first disable the correlation because

3512
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,599
different means

3513
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:10,800
okay

3514
02:08:08,238 --> 02:08:12,319
yeah that works and we just add a text

3515
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:13,440
description of the identity of the

3516
02:08:12,319 --> 02:08:22,319
person we can just say

3517
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:26,0
7693.44 --> 7706
teacher of the ceo's daughter

3518
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:27,439
okay now we're done we have now added

3519
02:08:26,0 --> 02:08:28,960
7706 --> 7708.96
the additional attribute and now now we

3520
02:08:27,439 --> 02:08:31,118
know what this object is actually about

3521
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:32,880
without having a description in there

3522
02:08:31,118 --> 02:08:34,960
but we still just have an email and a

3523
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,239
person described in here but we don't

3524
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:37,760
know anything else we

3525
02:08:36,238 --> 02:08:39,279
don't know that this email is proofing

3526
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:41,119
to be that person so we should add a

3527
02:08:39,279 --> 02:08:43,118
relationship between the two

3528
02:08:41,118 --> 02:08:44,639
now for this we can switch over to the

3529
02:08:43,118 --> 02:08:46,719
event graph view

3530
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:48,400
so that is a little bit further up this

3531
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:50,239
one allows us to create

3532
02:08:48,399 --> 02:08:52,0
7728.4 --> 7732
connected graphs out of our individual

3533
02:08:50,238 --> 02:08:54,559
data points so we see that we have

3534
02:08:52,0 --> 02:08:55,279
7732 --> 7735.28
two unreferenced objects so we explode

3535
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:58,639
that mode

3536
02:08:55,279 --> 02:09:00,719
by pressing x and we can we can draw

3537
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:02,639
an edge between those two nodes by

3538
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:04,319
clicking edit and add reference

3539
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:05,760
and drawing a line between the two from

3540
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:08,880
the

3541
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:08,880
email to the person

3542
02:09:09,39 --> 02:09:12,880
when you do that miss will propose a

3543
02:09:11,118 --> 02:09:15,39
list of relationship

3544
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:16,480
types between these two two different

3545
02:09:15,39 --> 02:09:18,158
nodes

3546
02:09:16,479 --> 02:09:19,439
there is also a custom one there so if

3547
02:09:18,158 --> 02:09:21,198
you don't want to select anything from

3548
02:09:19,439 --> 02:09:24,559
the list that is fine too but for now

3549
02:09:21,198 --> 02:09:26,238
we can just use the impersonates

3550
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:28,79
relationship which already exists in the

3551
02:09:26,238 --> 02:09:31,39
default library

3552
02:09:28,78 --> 02:09:31,39
just click on submit

3553
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:34,880
and now we have a relationship set

3554
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:36,78
between those two so we started telling

3555
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:37,520
our story by basically having a

3556
02:09:36,78 --> 02:09:40,399
connected graph between the

3557
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:40,880
these two points now let's further look

3558
02:09:40,399 --> 02:09:43,920
at our

3559
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:47,520
original email and see what else we can

3560
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:49,520
get out of the text from there

3561
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:51,199
we also see that the malicious file was

3562
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:54,0
7789.52 --> 7794
contained in the email as

3563
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:55,519
well as an attachment so let's upload an

3564
02:09:54,0 --> 02:09:57,198
7794 --> 7797.199
attachment now to ms

3565
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:58,880
i hope you have put in the text there or

3566
02:09:57,198 --> 02:10:01,359
something because i forgot to clearly

3567
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:01,359
i've

3568
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:07,279
so as an attachment and this is where

3569
02:10:05,439 --> 02:10:08,719
things become a little bit tricky

3570
02:10:07,279 --> 02:10:10,158
uh there's there's a quick question

3571
02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:11,920
there on the chat i'll just quickly

3572
02:10:10,158 --> 02:10:14,78
answer that then we can get back to this

3573
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:15,679
where can i create a reference if you go

3574
02:10:14,78 --> 02:10:17,519
above the attribute list there is an

3575
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:18,960
event graph button if you click on that

3576
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:20,719
you get the event graph

3577
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:22,800
and on the top left side you click on

3578
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:24,239
edit and then add reference

3579
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:26,639
like i can show it again nowadays oh

3580
02:10:24,238 --> 02:10:29,279
yeah that's a bit better here

3581
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:30,319
so have this kind of gray bar there with

3582
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:32,719
even graph

3583
02:10:30,319 --> 02:10:33,679
so you can basically collapse or expand

3584
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:36,880
it

3585
02:10:33,679 --> 02:10:37,359
uh and then there you can select one of

3586
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:40,480
those

3587
02:10:37,359 --> 02:10:41,39
reference objects you press x to expand

3588
02:10:40,479 --> 02:10:44,638
all those

3589
02:10:41,39 --> 02:10:47,679
reference objects then you can just

3590
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:51,39
select one object that you want

3591
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:53,39
to add and then you can edit add the

3592
02:10:51,39 --> 02:10:54,78
references and then you can add specific

3593
02:10:53,39 --> 02:10:55,599
references

3594
02:10:54,78 --> 02:10:56,960
in case it doesn't make sense to make a

3595
02:10:55,599 --> 02:10:57,760
second reference but that's basically

3596
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:59,279
how you do it

3597
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:01,280
then you select your relationship type

3598
02:10:59,279 --> 02:11:03,759
and you can add your reference

3599
02:11:01,279 --> 02:11:04,479
uh it's not the only way to do it

3600
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:06,79
there's a

3601
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:07,198
i would say current-based representation

3602
02:11:06,78 --> 02:11:09,118
where you can do it because we can't

3603
02:11:07,198 --> 02:11:11,519
even show it

3604
02:11:09,118 --> 02:11:13,39
so you have to go it's it's much more

3605
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:16,480
difficult to understand what happens

3606
02:11:13,39 --> 02:11:18,238
yeah so so there the referendum that you

3607
02:11:16,479 --> 02:11:20,959
created through the even graph

3608
02:11:18,238 --> 02:11:22,479
is represented here so you see that this

3609
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:24,399
object

3610
02:11:22,479 --> 02:11:25,598
has a reference so from email to

3611
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:27,39
impersonate

3612
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:28,960
and here's the opposite relationship

3613
02:11:27,39 --> 02:11:30,399
that you can describe the reference buy

3614
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:32,560
and you have the reference buy

3615
02:11:30,399 --> 02:11:33,679
on this object so another niche mention

3616
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:37,840
is i think

3617
02:11:33,679 --> 02:11:40,0
7893.679 --> 7900
less uh i would say 54 for

3618
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:41,199
and so on but sometimes you just when

3619
02:11:40,0 --> 02:11:43,39
7900 --> 7903.04
you are in the object you just want to

3620
02:11:41,198 --> 02:11:47,39
see if you have any reference or

3621
02:11:43,39 --> 02:11:47,39
a sign and you can quickly see that

3622
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:54,880
so let's add an attachment now

3623
02:11:53,39 --> 02:11:56,319
and upload the sample that was uh

3624
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:59,118
included in the

3625
02:11:56,319 --> 02:12:00,559
original uh email so we just click on

3626
02:11:59,118 --> 02:12:01,839
add attachment

3627
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:04,880
we select the file that you want to

3628
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:05,599
upload yeah so for the attachment uh in

3629
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:07,279
this you have

3630
02:12:05,599 --> 02:12:08,400
really two models you have the model

3631
02:12:07,279 --> 02:12:09,679
that an attachment is basically

3632
02:12:08,399 --> 02:12:12,479
something completely

3633
02:12:09,679 --> 02:12:13,118
uh being safe and you can basically

3634
02:12:12,479 --> 02:12:16,479
share it

3635
02:12:13,118 --> 02:12:17,359
uh directly so for example you have

3636
02:12:16,479 --> 02:12:20,399
attachment like

3637
02:12:17,359 --> 02:12:21,920
reports and stuff in our case um

3638
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:23,598
what we want to share here it's a

3639
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:25,760
malicious number um

3640
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:27,199
so and that's i will take i will take

3641
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:30,560
which one

3642
02:12:27,198 --> 02:12:30,559
take a sample somewhere

3643
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,560
um

3644
02:12:34,639 --> 02:12:38,78
press on one what we are interesting

3645
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:42,320
there

3646
02:12:38,78 --> 02:12:44,158
uh by the windows executables

3647
02:12:42,319 --> 02:12:45,599
and then you have to select if the

3648
02:12:44,158 --> 02:12:46,799
sample is malicious if you don't do

3649
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:48,239
anything

3650
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:50,880
what it will be it will be something

3651
02:12:48,238 --> 02:12:51,519
like same uh report a pdf report

3652
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:54,78
something that's

3653
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:55,599
like supporting you in contextualization

3654
02:12:54,78 --> 02:12:56,238
could be a screenshot for example things

3655
02:12:55,599 --> 02:12:58,400
like that

3656
02:12:56,238 --> 02:12:59,279
but if you share a sample you have to

3657
02:12:58,399 --> 02:13:02,158
select

3658
02:12:59,279 --> 02:13:03,920
uh it's a sample because like that mist

3659
02:13:02,158 --> 02:13:05,679
will encrypt

3660
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:07,679
and hash a file so that means you have a

3661
02:13:05,679 --> 02:13:08,719
zip file encrypted with a default

3662
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:11,679
password

3663
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:12,560
infected but i got to avoid classical

3664
02:13:11,679 --> 02:13:15,359
mistake of

3665
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:17,360
clicking on a link executing binaries on

3666
02:13:15,359 --> 02:13:18,799
your analysis machines and so on and so

3667
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:20,639
on you don't want to do that so

3668
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:22,0
7998.8 --> 8002
if it's malicious always click malware

3669
02:13:20,639 --> 02:13:23,440
samples

3670
02:13:22,0 --> 02:13:25,599
8002 --> 8005.599
then you have one below which will

3671
02:13:23,439 --> 02:13:27,919
advance the extraction

3672
02:13:25,599 --> 02:13:30,0
8005.599 --> 8010
uh mist can do a lot of things behind

3673
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:31,599
the scene when you receive a file in

3674
02:13:30,0 --> 02:13:34,800
8010 --> 8014.8
this case it's a window

3675
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:36,480
of windows portable executable files so

3676
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:37,920
we have particular advanced extraction

3677
02:13:36,479 --> 02:13:40,158
for those files and we can

3678
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:41,199
expand completely the files including

3679
02:13:40,158 --> 02:13:44,799
resources

3680
02:13:41,198 --> 02:13:48,0
8021.199 --> 8028
code segment and stuff again

3681
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:48,0
8024.8 --> 8028
so i will upload the files

3682
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:57,439
okay in this case this one was just like

3683
02:13:55,39 --> 02:14:00,78
a very simple one

3684
02:13:57,439 --> 02:14:01,279
so in this case what do we have we have

3685
02:14:00,78 --> 02:14:04,319
an object

3686
02:14:01,279 --> 02:14:06,559
with the file names the size invite and

3687
02:14:04,319 --> 02:14:08,158
then the hash file so automatically miss

3688
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:08,880
will do the hashing of the different

3689
02:14:08,158 --> 02:14:11,519
files

3690
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:12,0
8048.88 --> 8052
the sample itself is attached so you can

3691
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:14,880
basically

3692
02:14:12,0 --> 02:14:16,880
8052 --> 8056.88
use it and some additional ones like ssd

3693
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:18,880
for example my type are automatically

3694
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:20,480
extracted

3695
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:22,239
just maybe for the sake of it i will

3696
02:14:20,479 --> 02:14:25,359
just take maybe another

3697
02:14:22,238 --> 02:14:25,839
binary just for showing you what could

3698
02:14:25,359 --> 02:14:28,479
happen

3699
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:30,0
8065.84 --> 8070
with other binaries maybe that's for

3700
02:14:28,479 --> 02:14:32,559
later for different events so

3701
02:14:30,0 --> 02:14:33,439
8070 --> 8073.44
okay the objectives because it's easier

3702
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:35,360
to see for the

3703
02:14:33,439 --> 02:14:37,359
photograph that's fine too you can show

3704
02:14:35,359 --> 02:14:39,39
it afterwards yeah

3705
02:14:37,359 --> 02:14:41,39
okay so now we have this again this kind

3706
02:14:39,39 --> 02:14:42,719
of object attached and there's a

3707
02:14:41,39 --> 02:14:46,238
relationship to create objections

3708
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:48,0
8082.719 --> 8088
indeed so so in this case the

3709
02:14:46,238 --> 02:14:50,158
relationship is to the email itself so

3710
02:14:48,0 --> 02:14:52,319
8088 --> 8092.32
we know that the email contained

3711
02:14:50,158 --> 02:14:53,920
this file so what we can do is we can

3712
02:14:52,319 --> 02:14:54,479
just create relationship between the

3713
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:56,158
email

3714
02:14:54,479 --> 02:14:58,718
and the file and see that email contain

3715
02:14:56,158 --> 02:14:58,719
that file

3716
02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:04,800
do you see it it's again the same model

3717
02:15:02,639 --> 02:15:04,800
so

3718
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:09,840
contains

3719
02:15:15,439 --> 02:15:19,839
there we go so now what we can do is if

3720
02:15:18,319 --> 02:15:21,39
you look further in the email we see

3721
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:22,480
that there is a bunch of other stuff

3722
02:15:21,39 --> 02:15:23,198
still described so what we can do is we

3723
02:15:22,479 --> 02:15:27,598
can just

3724
02:15:23,198 --> 02:15:30,238
now for exercise sake just take um

3725
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:30,880
at least a next few lines or the next

3726
02:15:30,238 --> 02:15:33,198
paragraph

3727
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:35,118
and drop the entire paragraph into

3728
02:15:33,198 --> 02:15:37,118
something called the free text importer

3729
02:15:35,118 --> 02:15:38,319
what this will do is it will try to

3730
02:15:37,118 --> 02:15:40,238
parse this uh

3731
02:15:38,319 --> 02:15:41,679
this text blob and it will try to

3732
02:15:40,238 --> 02:15:43,678
extract anything that looks like an

3733
02:15:41,679 --> 02:15:44,319
indicator out of that so this is another

3734
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:46,78
method of

3735
02:15:44,319 --> 02:15:49,39
of basically entering attribute

3736
02:15:46,78 --> 02:15:51,679
synthesis so free text import

3737
02:15:49,39 --> 02:15:54,319
we just paste it in there and we just

3738
02:15:51,679 --> 02:15:54,319
hit submit

3739
02:15:54,399 --> 02:15:57,679
so this will tell us in this case it

3740
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:59,280
didn't extract everything actually so we

3741
02:15:57,679 --> 02:16:00,158
need to still go back to it and refined

3742
02:15:59,279 --> 02:16:01,920
a bit more

3743
02:16:00,158 --> 02:16:03,118
but it extracted some of those things

3744
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:05,39
that were in there already so that's

3745
02:16:03,118 --> 02:16:07,598
fine we can just already add those

3746
02:16:05,39 --> 02:16:07,599
to the event

3747
02:16:08,238 --> 02:16:12,479
so how does it work in in behind the

3748
02:16:10,238 --> 02:16:13,519
scenes uh we have a bunch of regex

3749
02:16:12,479 --> 02:16:15,198
images

3750
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:17,199
automatically extracting information

3751
02:16:15,198 --> 02:16:18,719
from from natural text

3752
02:16:17,198 --> 02:16:20,559
it's one way to do it there's another

3753
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:21,760
tool for doing it which is part of the

3754
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:24,639
even report

3755
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:26,159
um but it's usually it's a quick way to

3756
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:28,880
automatically extract information and to

3757
02:16:26,158 --> 02:16:31,198
see if it's already known for example

3758
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:32,318
so what we see here already is that evil

3759
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:35,119
provider

3760
02:16:32,318 --> 02:16:36,79
was basically according to the email

3761
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:38,800
text

3762
02:16:36,79 --> 02:16:40,959
and the place that was uh used to

3763
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:43,920
download the secondary payload from

3764
02:16:40,959 --> 02:16:44,558
so we can take evil provider and we also

3765
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:46,719
know that

3766
02:16:44,558 --> 02:16:47,920
we got an ipv6 address to it so we're

3767
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:51,39
going to add that to it as well and

3768
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:52,879
convert this into an object again

3769
02:16:51,40 --> 02:16:54,880
so we're going to to just select that

3770
02:16:52,879 --> 02:16:55,438
one convert to object and the object

3771
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:58,159
that we're

3772
02:16:55,439 --> 02:17:01,599
going to convert it to is going to be a

3773
02:16:58,159 --> 02:17:04,799
url object

3774
02:17:01,599 --> 02:17:07,120
yep all the way down there perfect

3775
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:08,558
let's just do the conversion and then we

3776
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:09,920
edit the object afterwards and we add

3777
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:12,318
the additional information that we have

3778
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:12,318
about it

3779
02:17:12,638 --> 02:17:18,318
so we have an ipv6 that we can that it

3780
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:18,318
resolves to

3781
02:17:24,239 --> 02:17:29,840
we also have a port so once we're done

3782
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:29,839
with that

3783
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:34,639
happy destination perfect

3784
02:17:36,159 --> 02:17:43,840
we can also add the port it was

3785
02:17:38,799 --> 02:17:43,840
communicating on port 443

3786
02:17:46,558 --> 02:17:50,239
and again everything i'm currently doing

3787
02:17:48,799 --> 02:17:53,920
there can be done through

3788
02:17:50,239 --> 02:17:57,840
api obviously yeah and and finally we

3789
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,840
also have a domain evilprovider.com

3790
02:18:02,638 --> 02:18:08,79
now let's deal with with referencing the

3791
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:09,40
this to the other objects later on we

3792
02:18:08,79 --> 02:18:11,280
can still

3793
02:18:09,40 --> 02:18:12,960
still add the additional information

3794
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:15,439
that we have in there and then we do the

3795
02:18:12,959 --> 02:18:17,358
linking afterwards again we we have the

3796
02:18:15,439 --> 02:18:20,159
same problem here on this one because

3797
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:21,760
you see that the command has a the part

3798
02:18:20,159 --> 02:18:23,679
it has a command so that means we can

3799
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:25,359
just convert it as an object again

3800
02:18:23,679 --> 02:18:27,679
yeah and the ip belongs to that one as

3801
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:30,719
well by the way okay great

3802
02:18:27,679 --> 02:18:31,679
it's even better yeah exactly just my

3803
02:18:30,718 --> 02:18:39,839
screen that is a bit

3804
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:39,840
smaller okay

3805
02:18:40,318 --> 02:18:43,920
so in this case it's again a url

3806
02:18:49,359 --> 02:18:54,719
and the things that we have this time

3807
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:56,239
the port is actually a high port so

3808
02:18:54,718 --> 02:18:58,79
while in the other one we do not

3809
02:18:56,239 --> 02:18:59,519
correlate on on the port because port

3810
02:18:58,79 --> 02:19:01,359
443 is common

3811
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:03,40
this is one of those ports that we might

3812
02:19:01,359 --> 02:19:04,639
want to correlate on already

3813
02:19:03,40 --> 02:19:07,840
so we want we don't want to disable

3814
02:19:04,638 --> 02:19:07,839
correlation for this one

3815
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:13,120
once for the other one we we should

3816
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:15,439
disable the correlation for the other

3817
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:15,439
part

3818
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:25,280
443

3819
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:27,280
okay now the other thing that we have at

3820
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:28,719
this point is we have a secondary sample

3821
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:30,719
so if you can you have a second one that

3822
02:19:28,718 --> 02:19:34,959
you can upload yeah i just just add the

3823
02:19:30,718 --> 02:19:39,279
domain so i get it

3824
02:19:34,959 --> 02:19:41,358
okay so what do you want

3825
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:42,479
so we still have another file to update

3826
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:45,359
and we have a cv

3827
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:48,318
that was also mentioned in the okay cv

3828
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:50,559
it's an interesting one um

3829
02:19:48,318 --> 02:19:51,519
we have we have single attributes for cd

3830
02:19:50,559 --> 02:19:53,119
but

3831
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:55,680
sometimes you want to have some more

3832
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:56,160
information so what you could do there

3833
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:58,960
is

3834
02:19:56,159 --> 02:20:02,719
to create a simple attribute um so the

3835
02:19:58,959 --> 02:20:05,438
cv is much better delivery in this case

3836
02:20:02,719 --> 02:20:08,79
we have type which is vulnerability and

3837
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:11,200
usually a venerability is defined by cv

3838
02:20:08,79 --> 02:20:12,719
you can you can use other value but

3839
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:14,880
the best practice is the obviously to

3840
02:20:12,719 --> 02:20:17,119
use cd

3841
02:20:14,879 --> 02:20:19,39
it's very old cv those kind of attackers

3842
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:21,120
are always reusing those kind of old

3843
02:20:19,40 --> 02:20:22,640
things but you know it works you know

3844
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:25,439
never people never patch i

3845
02:20:22,639 --> 02:20:26,799
know this one is interesting because you

3846
02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:29,439
know it was exploited

3847
02:20:26,799 --> 02:20:31,199
so i would add the ideas flag because it

3848
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:32,159
may be interesting to look into your

3849
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:35,40
system for

3850
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:36,398
additional ones so in this case what do

3851
02:20:35,40 --> 02:20:39,439
we have we have again

3852
02:20:36,398 --> 02:20:41,358
a single attribute which is not the nice

3853
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:43,520
thing that you want to have is basically

3854
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:44,318
you want to have as much context as you

3855
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:47,600
want

3856
02:20:44,318 --> 02:20:48,0
8444.319 --> 8448
for such kind of investigation luckily

3857
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:51,40
on

3858
02:20:48,0 --> 02:20:53,359
8448 --> 8453.359
this instance we have one of those

3859
02:20:51,40 --> 02:20:58,479
expansion modules

3860
02:20:53,359 --> 02:21:00,559
and why the cv advantage is okay

3861
02:20:58,478 --> 02:21:02,79
great so and then you have some

3862
02:21:00,559 --> 02:21:03,840
additional information in this case we

3863
02:21:02,79 --> 02:21:06,959
have some some description

3864
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:07,920
um so what i can do in this in this one

3865
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:11,358
is

3866
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:14,639
so you see that we have either the

3867
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:16,318
overlay uh thing so in these modules uh

3868
02:21:14,639 --> 02:21:16,959
someone was asking about extension of

3869
02:21:16,318 --> 02:21:18,719
this

3870
02:21:16,959 --> 02:21:19,759
is one way you have this overlay things

3871
02:21:18,719 --> 02:21:20,639
where you can basically just do

3872
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:23,680
expansions

3873
02:21:20,639 --> 02:21:25,119
and see okay contextual information but

3874
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:26,960
sometimes you just want to be

3875
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:29,190
to have a bit more than just contextual

3876
02:21:26,959 --> 02:21:31,199
information uh you want to have

3877
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:33,920
[Music]

3878
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:36,240
the uh associated object then so there

3879
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:38,159
you have this this kind of

3880
02:21:36,239 --> 02:21:40,879
kind of explosion there and you can add

3881
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:42,79
the enrichment i'll give a try on that

3882
02:21:40,879 --> 02:21:44,79
one

3883
02:21:42,79 --> 02:21:45,920
okay great so there's something wrong on

3884
02:21:44,79 --> 02:21:48,478
this machine that's great

3885
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:49,840
i'll take the other one but this this

3886
02:21:48,478 --> 02:21:53,199
it's not an object for that

3887
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:55,120
that's fine we can just like yeah can

3888
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:56,399
summon the attribute in this case

3889
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:58,560
so we have basically the description

3890
02:21:56,398 --> 02:22:01,599
then coming from the enrichment

3891
02:21:58,559 --> 02:22:04,239
and what we can do is to uh

3892
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:05,520
then make an object called vulnerability

3893
02:22:04,239 --> 02:22:07,920
then

3894
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:09,359
id credit in this case is the

3895
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:12,398
descriptions

3896
02:22:09,359 --> 02:22:14,559
and make an object of it usually you

3897
02:22:12,398 --> 02:22:16,639
should have a full

3898
02:22:14,559 --> 02:22:19,39
expansion there but i didn't test it on

3899
02:22:16,639 --> 02:22:22,559
the training instance maybe something is

3900
02:22:19,40 --> 02:22:23,280
broken on that instance okay so now what

3901
02:22:22,559 --> 02:22:25,920
do we have is

3902
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:27,840
it's more contextual information we we

3903
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:29,520
start with a story and there

3904
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:31,920
we see that we have an emails we have a

3905
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:34,640
first url a second one which is a

3906
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:36,239
download and a specific cv so maybe no

3907
02:22:34,639 --> 02:22:38,79
we can go back to the uh

3908
02:22:36,239 --> 02:22:39,280
we still miss one thing which was a

3909
02:22:38,79 --> 02:22:42,239
secondary file that was

3910
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:43,40
downloaded oh okay from the secondary

3911
02:22:42,239 --> 02:22:46,799
files yes

3912
02:22:43,40 --> 02:22:47,280
yeah so according to story what happens

3913
02:22:46,799 --> 02:22:50,318
was

3914
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:52,319
uh the initial sample was uh

3915
02:22:50,318 --> 02:22:54,239
when executed was downloading a

3916
02:22:52,318 --> 02:22:56,559
secondary

3917
02:22:54,239 --> 02:22:57,680
sample and that one was basically then

3918
02:22:56,559 --> 02:23:00,719
used to

3919
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:01,40
exfiltrate data from from the system yes

3920
02:23:00,719 --> 02:23:03,519
so

3921
02:23:01,40 --> 02:23:05,200
this was a new railway download the

3922
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:08,479
interest files okay

3923
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:09,600
then i will add a yeah just another file

3924
02:23:08,478 --> 02:23:11,599
and we just

3925
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:13,200
pretend it's the one that we were

3926
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:14,239
supposed to use why is this one it makes

3927
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:17,280
sense it's an emote that's one

3928
02:23:14,239 --> 02:23:17,280
downloaded form in your eyes

3929
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:20,159
that makes sense

3930
02:23:21,359 --> 02:23:24,399
so now we have all these different

3931
02:23:22,959 --> 02:23:25,919
objects in our event and it's time to

3932
02:23:24,398 --> 02:23:27,439
build the story out of it as alex has

3933
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:33,840
mentioned so it's time to go back to our

3934
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:33,840
event graph

3935
02:23:34,879 --> 02:23:38,0
8614.88 --> 8618
and basically uh so far the story is

3936
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:39,920
that we got

3937
02:23:38,0 --> 02:23:42,559
8618 --> 8622.56
an email the email was impersonating a

3938
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:44,799
person and we basically got

3939
02:23:42,559 --> 02:23:45,840
a primary sample out of the that primary

3940
02:23:44,799 --> 02:23:50,398
sample then reaches

3941
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:50,398
out to evilprovider.com

3942
02:23:50,559 --> 02:23:55,600
to download a secondary sample so we

3943
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:59,120
have a relationship

3944
02:23:55,600 --> 02:24:02,239
between the file

3945
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:02,240
which downloads from

3946
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:09,119
downloads from yeah perfect

3947
02:24:06,959 --> 02:24:10,799
from evil provider and then evil

3948
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:15,840
provider downloads

3949
02:24:10,799 --> 02:24:15,840
the secondary sample

3950
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:29,840
which is in this case index dot html one

3951
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:43,840
and this one then exfiltrates to the

3952
02:24:36,398 --> 02:24:43,840
another evil provider url

3953
02:24:52,239 --> 02:24:55,600
now there's one thing we missed in the

3954
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:57,40
story here is that the first one try so

3955
02:24:55,600 --> 02:25:00,159
in this case trilogy

3956
02:24:57,40 --> 02:25:03,40
was actually abusing the cve that uh

3957
02:25:00,159 --> 02:25:04,398
that alex has already expanded so we

3958
02:25:03,40 --> 02:25:08,560
have an abuser's

3959
02:25:04,398 --> 02:25:08,559
relationship from trilogothexa to

3960
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:11,840
vulnerability

3961
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:17,359
so and once we're done with this we

3962
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:19,439
already see the entire store in this car

3963
02:25:17,359 --> 02:25:20,800
so even if you if you have no idea about

3964
02:25:19,439 --> 02:25:22,800
what happened in the report and you

3965
02:25:20,799 --> 02:25:24,318
don't read the original report

3966
02:25:22,799 --> 02:25:26,478
by just looking at this graph you can

3967
02:25:24,318 --> 02:25:29,519
clearly read it out

3968
02:25:26,478 --> 02:25:31,519
in in in simple sentences we see email

3969
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:34,960
in person later first and john

3970
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:36,159
email contains trilogy exploits

3971
02:25:34,959 --> 02:25:39,159
vulnerability

3972
02:25:36,159 --> 02:25:40,318
downloads from evoprovider.com

3973
02:25:39,159 --> 02:25:43,680
index.html1

3974
02:25:40,318 --> 02:25:45,760
which exfiltrates to a url so it's a

3975
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:46,79
very simple story to comprehend without

3976
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:48,239
us

3977
02:25:46,79 --> 02:25:50,0
8746.08 --> 8750
knowing the original data information

3978
02:25:48,239 --> 02:25:50,318
and without us having even having to

3979
02:25:50,0 --> 02:25:52,0
8750 --> 8752
look

3980
02:25:50,318 --> 02:25:53,359
at the individual indicators further

3981
02:25:52,0 --> 02:25:55,760
8752 --> 8755.76
below

3982
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:56,800
so this is when we're talking about

3983
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:59,40
information sharing

3984
02:25:56,799 --> 02:26:00,478
we're basically sharing on two layers

3985
02:25:59,40 --> 02:26:02,640
one of the layers is sharing with

3986
02:26:00,478 --> 02:26:04,79
machines so informing an ids about

3987
02:26:02,639 --> 02:26:05,599
things to alert on

3988
02:26:04,79 --> 02:26:07,280
and at the same time we're sharing with

3989
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:09,40
analysts that want to really understand

3990
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:09,600
what the introductory was doing in this

3991
02:26:09,40 --> 02:26:11,760
case

3992
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:13,120
and what happened during the incident

3993
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:15,600
however at this stage

3994
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:17,520
we have described our event but we're

3995
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:20,479
still missing something at this point

3996
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:21,760
we still haven't actually contextualized

3997
02:26:20,478 --> 02:26:23,39
the information with everything else

3998
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:26,159
that we know about it

3999
02:26:23,40 --> 02:26:27,40
so we have we have vocabularies at our

4000
02:26:26,159 --> 02:26:28,879
disposal

4001
02:26:27,40 --> 02:26:30,399
we have at the attack matrix at our

4002
02:26:28,879 --> 02:26:31,679
disposal so let's

4003
02:26:30,398 --> 02:26:33,760
start going through the individual

4004
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:34,559
attributes and let's start to attach

4005
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:37,520
those different

4006
02:26:34,559 --> 02:26:38,79
labels to the data so first of all if we

4007
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:41,120
look at

4008
02:26:38,79 --> 02:26:42,318
uh perhaps which one which one should we

4009
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:44,79
start with

4010
02:26:42,318 --> 02:26:45,760
let's not do everything let's look at

4011
02:26:44,79 --> 02:26:47,520
the original email for example

4012
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:49,120
we know that the original email deals

4013
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:51,120
with fishing now

4014
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:52,720
attack has a pattern that describes

4015
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:55,760
fishing so we can just attach

4016
02:26:52,719 --> 02:26:59,279
the galaxy cluster of attack to

4017
02:26:55,760 --> 02:27:02,960
and to the attributes in there so

4018
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:04,800
we use cluster yeah and we can just use

4019
02:27:02,959 --> 02:27:07,759
the text

4020
02:27:04,799 --> 02:27:08,318
magic perfect and we can click on attack

4021
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:11,200
pattern

4022
02:27:08,318 --> 02:27:12,79
then we get the attack matrix and here

4023
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:16,290
we can select

4024
02:27:12,79 --> 02:27:19,120
uh phishing it should be in

4025
02:27:16,290 --> 02:27:20,880
[Music]

4026
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:23,359
you see yeah there it is perfect so we

4027
02:27:20,879 --> 02:27:23,358
attach it

4028
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:27,359
we refresh and there we see it is now

4029
02:27:26,318 --> 02:27:30,0
8846.319 --> 8850
attached to the

4030
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:31,680
attribute and if we if we generate a

4031
02:27:30,0 --> 02:27:32,879
8850 --> 8852.88
heat pack now out of the events if we

4032
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:35,680
scroll up

4033
02:27:32,879 --> 02:27:37,39
we have an attack matrix view next to

4034
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:39,520
the event graph

4035
02:27:37,40 --> 02:27:40,399
if we click on that one now we now see

4036
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:43,200
that

4037
02:27:40,398 --> 02:27:44,0
8860.399 --> 8864
as a first overview already we know

4038
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:45,520
without looking

4039
02:27:44,0 --> 02:27:47,359
8864 --> 8867.359
at any of the details we see that we're

4040
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:48,800
dealing with positioning here so this is

4041
02:27:47,359 --> 02:27:49,600
one of the attack patterns that we've

4042
02:27:48,799 --> 02:27:50,879
described

4043
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:52,399
let's see what other attack patterns

4044
02:27:50,879 --> 02:27:53,920
from attack we can describe you also see

4045
02:27:52,398 --> 02:27:55,599
that there is automated

4046
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:57,520
exfiltration happening so if we go to

4047
02:27:55,600 --> 02:28:01,840
the secondary url

4048
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:01,840
so another evilprovider.com

4049
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:06,960
we can attach the pattern there as well

4050
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:08,560
now we can choose to do

4051
02:28:06,959 --> 02:28:10,159
a single attribute what we're doing or

4052
02:28:08,559 --> 02:28:11,760
we can just select all four and attach

4053
02:28:10,159 --> 02:28:12,0
8890.16 --> 8892
the cluster tool for let's just do one

4054
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:15,120
for

4055
02:28:12,0 --> 02:28:19,760
8892 --> 8899.76
now it's it's it's enough

4056
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:19,760
uh watch out it's uh yeah perfect

4057
02:28:21,40 --> 02:28:24,399
and just pick automated exfiltration

4058
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:27,840
it's the

4059
02:28:24,398 --> 02:28:27,840
first one on the yeah

4060
02:28:30,79 --> 02:28:33,120
okay so now we've attached some attack

4061
02:28:32,0 --> 02:28:35,280
8912 --> 8915.28
patterns uh

4062
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:36,720
we we could attach it to the sample as

4063
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:38,479
well what the sample is doing but we're

4064
02:28:36,719 --> 02:28:40,478
not going to go through

4065
02:28:38,478 --> 02:28:42,239
all that effort let's look at some type

4066
02:28:40,478 --> 02:28:45,679
of contextualization

4067
02:28:42,239 --> 02:28:47,119
for example maybe this

4068
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:49,200
then it's a matter of test again

4069
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:50,560
regarding the at which level you want to

4070
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:53,840
attach

4071
02:28:50,559 --> 02:28:54,959
the galaxy there is the topic is a

4072
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:57,439
matter of fishing

4073
02:28:54,959 --> 02:29:00,398
at a global level usually we can add a

4074
02:28:57,439 --> 02:29:04,239
galaxy there and then for example

4075
02:29:00,398 --> 02:29:07,519
add my tray attack directly there

4076
02:29:04,239 --> 02:29:09,840
and select the pattern fishing then

4077
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:11,600
the techniques there directly so you

4078
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:13,760
have different options

4079
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:15,760
usually we recommend to make it as

4080
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:17,200
attribute level

4081
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:18,880
but in some case you don't even know

4082
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:22,79
which attribute level it applies

4083
02:29:18,879 --> 02:29:24,318
then you select the even level exactly

4084
02:29:22,79 --> 02:29:25,840
so so that's indeed a good point if you

4085
02:29:24,318 --> 02:29:26,959
know that the entire chain of what

4086
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:29,680
you're describing

4087
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:32,0
8966.96 --> 8972
referring to the single uh

4088
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:34,559
contextualization beta label be it a

4089
02:29:32,0 --> 02:29:36,398
8972 --> 8976.399
galaxy cluster then indeed what we

4090
02:29:34,559 --> 02:29:38,719
assume is anything that you label on the

4091
02:29:36,398 --> 02:29:41,439
event level is inherited by all

4092
02:29:38,719 --> 02:29:42,398
uh data contained in unless explicitly

4093
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:45,760
overwritten by

4094
02:29:42,398 --> 02:29:48,478
the opposite tag basically so

4095
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:49,439
so indeed that's the case uh in this

4096
02:29:48,478 --> 02:29:51,39
case

4097
02:29:49,439 --> 02:29:52,720
we're kind of in a weird situation

4098
02:29:51,40 --> 02:29:54,560
because we're describing the full chain

4099
02:29:52,719 --> 02:29:56,719
of the attack which includes initial

4100
02:29:54,559 --> 02:29:58,559
phishing attempt but also includes the

4101
02:29:56,719 --> 02:29:59,358
secondary payload and the exfiltration

4102
02:29:58,559 --> 02:30:00,959
and so on

4103
02:29:59,359 --> 02:30:02,479
and if we if you do this on the

4104
02:30:00,959 --> 02:30:03,39
attribute level i suppose the event

4105
02:30:02,478 --> 02:30:05,519
level

4106
02:30:03,40 --> 02:30:06,560
then you're really really only

4107
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:08,479
describing

4108
02:30:06,559 --> 02:30:10,398
which part deals with the fishing which

4109
02:30:08,478 --> 02:30:11,39
part deals with the actual exfiltration

4110
02:30:10,398 --> 02:30:12,799
and so on

4111
02:30:11,40 --> 02:30:14,640
so this is really up to you what we

4112
02:30:12,799 --> 02:30:16,398
generally recommend is

4113
02:30:14,639 --> 02:30:18,398
don't just do it on the event level so

4114
02:30:16,398 --> 02:30:19,439
if you're describing more concepts in a

4115
02:30:18,398 --> 02:30:20,719
single event

4116
02:30:19,439 --> 02:30:22,559
make sure that you contextualize

4117
02:30:20,719 --> 02:30:23,920
individual parts of it

4118
02:30:22,559 --> 02:30:25,840
because one of one of the things that we

4119
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:27,359
use these labels for as well is searches

4120
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:28,318
so if i were to search for all

4121
02:30:27,359 --> 02:30:30,800
indicators

4122
02:30:28,318 --> 02:30:32,159
that relate to phishing i might not want

4123
02:30:30,799 --> 02:30:35,920
to get the secondary

4124
02:30:32,159 --> 02:30:37,760
payloads effects uh included in that

4125
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:39,359
response because that was just the

4126
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:41,200
initial vector of getting into the

4127
02:30:39,359 --> 02:30:42,880
network of the victim

4128
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:44,720
whatever happens afterwards is not

4129
02:30:42,879 --> 02:30:46,959
directly related to the phishing

4130
02:30:44,719 --> 02:30:48,478
so keep that in mind as well something

4131
02:30:46,959 --> 02:30:50,559
else

4132
02:30:48,478 --> 02:30:52,799
yeah so some just just something that

4133
02:30:50,559 --> 02:30:54,639
you have to keep in mind too it's about

4134
02:30:52,799 --> 02:30:56,79
which classification to choose or which

4135
02:30:54,639 --> 02:30:56,799
contractualization source you have to

4136
02:30:56,79 --> 02:30:59,600
want to

4137
02:30:56,799 --> 02:31:00,79
to use um on this instance we have

4138
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:02,800
already

4139
02:31:00,79 --> 02:31:04,639
a lot of things enabled and if for

4140
02:31:02,799 --> 02:31:06,79
example you go for taxonomy

4141
02:31:04,639 --> 02:31:08,478
you have a lot of taxonomy that is

4142
02:31:06,79 --> 02:31:10,719
describing fishing

4143
02:31:08,478 --> 02:31:11,760
for for example you have even a complete

4144
02:31:10,719 --> 02:31:14,959
taxonomy

4145
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:15,680
about the kind of fishing you have and

4146
02:31:14,959 --> 02:31:18,639
so on

4147
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:21,280
so when you install your miss pinstance

4148
02:31:18,639 --> 02:31:23,358
and you start to make it operational

4149
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:24,800
you really have to decide what kind of

4150
02:31:23,359 --> 02:31:26,720
taxonomy you want to use

4151
02:31:24,799 --> 02:31:29,920
in this case we have already a lot of

4152
02:31:26,719 --> 02:31:32,478
things are available by default

4153
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:35,200
so the fishing taxonomy itself is a

4154
02:31:32,478 --> 02:31:37,358
complete one coming from a finger

4155
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:39,840
towards academic paper where we have all

4156
02:31:37,359 --> 02:31:41,600
the techniques that are used so

4157
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:44,239
for example you can say that this one is

4158
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:44,239
coming from a

4159
02:31:44,559 --> 02:31:51,439
spearfishing which was described there

4160
02:31:48,318 --> 02:31:54,0
9108.319 --> 9114
and you have the different techniques

4161
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:55,520
so in this case it's email spoofing and

4162
02:31:54,0 --> 02:31:57,760
9114 --> 9117.76
you can go deeper there

4163
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:58,720
into the description of what is exactly

4164
02:31:57,760 --> 02:32:01,840
the decision

4165
02:31:58,719 --> 02:32:04,0
9118.72 --> 9124
and you can mix match both i mean under

4166
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:06,478
selectively attack

4167
02:32:04,0 --> 02:32:07,200
9124 --> 9127.2
fishing techniques at specific indicator

4168
02:32:06,478 --> 02:32:09,438
level

4169
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:10,560
maybe another analyst would want to

4170
02:32:09,439 --> 02:32:12,239
classify it

4171
02:32:10,559 --> 02:32:14,559
and and maybe the objectives might be

4172
02:32:12,239 --> 02:32:16,719
different maybe on one for example

4173
02:32:14,559 --> 02:32:18,719
it's more specific for tools but if you

4174
02:32:16,719 --> 02:32:20,639
want to run out statistics

4175
02:32:18,719 --> 02:32:22,0
9138.72 --> 9142
at the end of i don't know quite early

4176
02:32:20,639 --> 02:32:23,840
meetings and say okay

4177
02:32:22,0 --> 02:32:25,600
9142 --> 9145.6
how many spearfishing that you receive

4178
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:27,200
or many emails proofing

4179
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:29,840
for example if you can control better

4180
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:30,720
emails proofing uh the spf record and so

4181
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:32,960
on you can

4182
02:32:30,719 --> 02:32:34,719
just look at the current uh technique

4183
02:32:32,959 --> 02:32:35,599
that are used by by the attacker so you

4184
02:32:34,719 --> 02:32:38,239
see that

4185
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:40,79
those kind of it's full of taxonomies

4186
02:32:38,239 --> 02:32:42,799
that are can be used

4187
02:32:40,79 --> 02:32:44,559
and obviously we usually recommend to

4188
02:32:42,799 --> 02:32:46,639
not enable everything but just

4189
02:32:44,559 --> 02:32:47,680
pick what you really want and some are

4190
02:32:46,639 --> 02:32:50,79
very generic

4191
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:51,40
some are more advanced but that's maybe

4192
02:32:50,79 --> 02:32:54,559
something that you

4193
02:32:51,40 --> 02:32:56,319
we dig into more afterwards but

4194
02:32:54,559 --> 02:32:57,840
just be careful of which kind of

4195
02:32:56,318 --> 02:32:58,799
taxonomy you want to use because it will

4196
02:32:57,840 --> 02:33:01,280
be the language

4197
02:32:58,799 --> 02:33:02,478
that you use with the community and your

4198
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:07,840
partners

4199
02:33:02,478 --> 02:33:07,840
for sharing this information

4200
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:12,640
maybe something interesting to look into

4201
02:33:10,879 --> 02:33:14,478
the email and that's linked to

4202
02:33:12,639 --> 02:33:16,0
9192.64 --> 9196
classifications but there's this comment

4203
02:33:14,478 --> 02:33:17,840
there please

4204
02:33:16,0 --> 02:33:19,520
9196 --> 9199.52
please be mindful that this is an

4205
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:22,0
9197.84 --> 9202
ongoing investigation and we would like

4206
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:23,920
to avoid

4207
02:33:22,0 --> 02:33:25,439
9202 --> 9205.439
informing the attacker or the detection

4208
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:28,478
and can we ask you to

4209
02:33:25,439 --> 02:33:32,318
to only use the content information

4210
02:33:28,478 --> 02:33:34,0
9208.479 --> 9214
to to protect your constituents so

4211
02:33:32,318 --> 02:33:35,519
this is kind of that you are language

4212
02:33:34,0 --> 02:33:37,600
9214 --> 9217.6
describing to you what kind of

4213
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:40,640
classification it is

4214
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:44,479
um and so no

4215
02:33:40,639 --> 02:33:46,799
which one should we use so um if we are

4216
02:33:44,478 --> 02:33:48,639
first members if we are using the first

4217
02:33:46,799 --> 02:33:50,159
community obviously the classification

4218
02:33:48,639 --> 02:33:52,398
that we will use

4219
02:33:50,159 --> 02:33:53,600
is not the nato one or the ministry of

4220
02:33:52,398 --> 02:33:57,920
defense in whatever

4221
02:33:53,600 --> 02:34:01,840
country it's really tlp so then again

4222
02:33:57,920 --> 02:34:05,920
based on that we will look into

4223
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:09,200
different taxonomy that we have

4224
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:12,719
we can look for for tlp

4225
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:15,280
and i should not do that like that

4226
02:34:12,719 --> 02:34:17,39
i go for the tlp library and then i have

4227
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:21,120
the

4228
02:34:17,40 --> 02:34:22,240
specific taxonomy tlp and then you have

4229
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:24,560
the different one

4230
02:34:22,239 --> 02:34:27,280
in this case they say you have to share

4231
02:34:24,559 --> 02:34:29,840
it with your confusion only so

4232
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:30,800
tlp amber seems to be the most

4233
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:33,280
appropriate

4234
02:34:30,799 --> 02:34:34,879
one we say that the lpm bill information

4235
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:36,399
is given to organization

4236
02:34:34,879 --> 02:34:38,0
9274.88 --> 9278
sharing limited within organization to

4237
02:34:36,398 --> 02:34:40,639
basically act upon

4238
02:34:38,0 --> 02:34:41,439
9278 --> 9281.439
if we have the extended classifications

4239
02:34:40,639 --> 02:34:44,478
from first

4240
02:34:41,439 --> 02:34:47,200
it includes the constituent

4241
02:34:44,478 --> 02:34:48,559
too so i will just use a tmp but i

4242
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:50,159
mentioned something else that is

4243
02:34:48,559 --> 02:34:52,959
interesting

4244
02:34:50,159 --> 02:34:53,600
in the email they mentioned that this is

4245
02:34:52,959 --> 02:34:57,199
an ongoing

4246
02:34:53,600 --> 02:35:00,479
association to avoid

4247
02:34:57,200 --> 02:35:02,479
informing the attacker in this case

4248
02:35:00,478 --> 02:35:03,760
or would you inform the attacker but if

4249
02:35:02,478 --> 02:35:06,79
you do actions

4250
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:08,79
on specific indicators and attributes

4251
02:35:06,79 --> 02:35:10,239
you might want to restrict that

4252
02:35:08,79 --> 02:35:13,200
so there is a another classification i

4253
02:35:10,239 --> 02:35:16,398
don't know if this one is enabled

4254
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:19,840
it's called pap which is exactly that

4255
02:35:16,398 --> 02:35:22,559
it's similar to tlp but describing

4256
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:24,159
what you can do with this information if

4257
02:35:22,559 --> 02:35:26,799
we don't want to

4258
02:35:24,159 --> 02:35:27,439
at least notify the attacker that we are

4259
02:35:26,799 --> 02:35:29,679
doing some

4260
02:35:27,439 --> 02:35:31,40
further investigations maybe we want to

4261
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:34,0
9329.68 --> 9334
restrict that

4262
02:35:31,40 --> 02:35:35,840
and the prp is really telling you what

4263
02:35:34,0 --> 02:35:37,200
9334 --> 9337.2
are the permissive action that you can

4264
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:40,239
do

4265
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:42,479
in our case for example

4266
02:35:40,239 --> 02:35:43,520
non-detectable actions only and that's

4267
02:35:42,478 --> 02:35:46,398
really what he wants

4268
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:48,239
because the supporters say okay we have

4269
02:35:46,398 --> 02:35:49,519
an ongoing investigation so you don't

4270
02:35:48,239 --> 02:35:51,600
want to be here

4271
02:35:49,520 --> 02:35:53,120
um other parties are informed so in this

4272
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:56,800
case i will use

4273
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:58,800
red and again this is used at even level

4274
02:35:56,799 --> 02:36:00,478
and that's something quite important

4275
02:35:58,799 --> 02:36:02,719
because myth will take care of that

4276
02:36:00,478 --> 02:36:04,639
um you don't need to set pp rate on

4277
02:36:02,719 --> 02:36:07,920
every single attribute

4278
02:36:04,639 --> 02:36:09,279
behind it's really at even level so it's

4279
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:12,239
automatically

4280
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:14,0
9369.28 --> 9374
irritating on all attributes we don't

4281
02:36:12,239 --> 02:36:16,0
9372.24 --> 9376
show it on the interface

4282
02:36:14,0 --> 02:36:18,239
9374 --> 9378.24
because it will be two clamps to you

4283
02:36:16,0 --> 02:36:21,600
9376 --> 9381.6
know overload it with information

4284
02:36:18,239 --> 02:36:23,280
but we do it in a way that's on the api

4285
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:26,0
9381.6 --> 9386
level if you do section of search for

4286
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:28,319
example on even level or attribute level

4287
02:36:26,0 --> 02:36:30,318
9386 --> 9390.319
pip red will be included there if you

4288
02:36:28,318 --> 02:36:32,318
have an attribute

4289
02:36:30,318 --> 02:36:34,799
containing some information

4290
02:36:32,318 --> 02:36:38,559
automatically tags like papers will be

4291
02:36:34,799 --> 02:36:40,0
9394.8 --> 9400
then included into the information so

4292
02:36:38,559 --> 02:36:41,840
that's something to keep in mind when we

4293
02:36:40,0 --> 02:36:43,359
9400 --> 9403.359
have information from third party

4294
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:45,439
is to to wonder okay what is a

4295
02:36:43,359 --> 02:36:46,559
classification scheme so sometimes they

4296
02:36:45,439 --> 02:36:48,398
don't say

4297
02:36:46,559 --> 02:36:50,478
a specific classification to use that

4298
02:36:48,398 --> 02:36:53,439
you just use natural language or

4299
02:36:50,478 --> 02:36:56,159
just a normal sentence to describe all

4300
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:57,760
the information should be shared

4301
02:36:56,159 --> 02:36:59,200
so the interesting thing here is that

4302
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:00,800
what we've seen now is we've

4303
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:02,399
contextualized information in many

4304
02:37:00,799 --> 02:37:05,519
different aspects and this is just

4305
02:37:02,398 --> 02:37:08,159
scraping the uh

4306
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:09,760
the top layer basically we could go much

4307
02:37:08,159 --> 02:37:11,680
much further with contextualization

4308
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:13,359
imagine for example describing

4309
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:15,120
how this information is relevant to

4310
02:37:13,359 --> 02:37:16,239
whether it's used what sort of

4311
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:17,920
mechanisms they should

4312
02:37:16,239 --> 02:37:19,760
have in place to be able to block this

4313
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:20,879
information how can you make this useful

4314
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:22,159
think of different maturity

4315
02:37:20,879 --> 02:37:23,679
organizations as well when you're

4316
02:37:22,159 --> 02:37:25,280
sharing information

4317
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:26,639
you could also describe information

4318
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:27,840
about who's behind it what the

4319
02:37:26,639 --> 02:37:29,920
motivations are

4320
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:31,760
so we did not describe the threat actor

4321
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:33,359
because we we haven't done any analysis

4322
02:37:31,760 --> 02:37:34,318
yet this is the initial information we

4323
02:37:33,359 --> 02:37:36,640
got from

4324
02:37:34,318 --> 02:37:38,959
a cser that just reported an incident to

4325
02:37:36,639 --> 02:37:41,39
us but we could go further and we

4326
02:37:38,959 --> 02:37:42,799
if we did our analysis we would find

4327
02:37:41,40 --> 02:37:44,960
who's behind this we could go for it

4328
02:37:42,799 --> 02:37:47,119
for uh for information with threat actor

4329
02:37:44,959 --> 02:37:49,279
we could look at target sectors

4330
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:51,600
we could look at a lot of different

4331
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:52,960
information in regards to

4332
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:55,439
to further contextualizing the

4333
02:37:52,959 --> 02:37:55,438
information

4334
02:37:58,239 --> 02:38:01,439
so in this case we could also for

4335
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:02,479
example say that's in the truth where

4336
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:03,680
because we we know that this is

4337
02:38:02,478 --> 02:38:05,119
something that was targeting an

4338
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:07,760
organization luxembourg

4339
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:08,720
we know it was there is also a sector uh

4340
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:11,359
taxonomy

4341
02:38:08,719 --> 02:38:12,639
that you can use so that's not a galaxy

4342
02:38:11,359 --> 02:38:14,720
but the taxonomy

4343
02:38:12,639 --> 02:38:16,398
so we can also add uh for example

4344
02:38:14,719 --> 02:38:17,438
information about the financial sector

4345
02:38:16,398 --> 02:38:20,79
we know the ceo

4346
02:38:17,439 --> 02:38:21,600
is a ceo financial sector organization

4347
02:38:20,79 --> 02:38:23,760
so we could also say that it's

4348
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:25,120
it probably has to do with that as well

4349
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:29,840
maybe it's not enabled

4350
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:29,840
sorry about that yeah this is

4351
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:35,200
exactly there if you just search for

4352
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:37,680
sector it should be there

4353
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:38,319
yeah but i'm i'm yeah there's something

4354
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:41,600
that you can do

4355
02:38:38,318 --> 02:38:46,79
talk about about later but it's uh

4356
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:48,159
just a sector so we have different one

4357
02:38:46,79 --> 02:38:49,680
you did find that so if you there was

4358
02:38:48,159 --> 02:38:51,840
one for finance you can just pick that

4359
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:51,840
yeah

4360
02:38:52,639 --> 02:38:57,519
something else you can you can do and

4361
02:38:54,879 --> 02:38:59,39
this one is important too it's it's

4362
02:38:57,520 --> 02:39:01,280
going a bit further than the email so

4363
02:38:59,40 --> 02:39:02,560
for example as a source we receive

4364
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:04,79
emails from various people

4365
02:39:02,559 --> 02:39:05,359
i mean if i receive an email from i

4366
02:39:04,79 --> 02:39:05,920
don't know from an analyst from i don't

4367
02:39:05,359 --> 02:39:08,720
know

4368
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:10,478
he set mcafee and found that i'm working

4369
02:39:08,719 --> 02:39:12,719
with them for years

4370
02:39:10,478 --> 02:39:13,679
my confidence on this information is

4371
02:39:12,719 --> 02:39:16,79
quite high

4372
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:17,600
on the other hand if i receive an email

4373
02:39:16,79 --> 02:39:19,39
from someone unknown

4374
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:20,880
maybe my confidence will be a bit

4375
02:39:19,40 --> 02:39:22,479
different so

4376
02:39:20,879 --> 02:39:24,478
in myths you have plenty of taxonomies

4377
02:39:22,478 --> 02:39:26,239
to express confidence

4378
02:39:24,478 --> 02:39:28,799
for example the one that is actively

4379
02:39:26,239 --> 02:39:32,0
9566.24 --> 9572
used for empowering the military

4380
02:39:28,799 --> 02:39:34,799
network is scale or nato scale

4381
02:39:32,0 --> 02:39:35,920
9572 --> 9575.92
where you can basically define the

4382
02:39:34,799 --> 02:39:37,438
credibility of the

4383
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:39,600
of the source in this case we can say

4384
02:39:37,439 --> 02:39:40,639
that we are we know the source and is

4385
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:43,40
usually really

4386
02:39:40,639 --> 02:39:45,358
reliable so that's the source itself and

4387
02:39:43,40 --> 02:39:46,80
we can say for this specific information

4388
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:49,280
that is

4389
02:39:46,79 --> 02:39:51,39
um probably true

4390
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:53,439
because they send us some evidence now

4391
02:39:51,40 --> 02:39:53,760
if i have like three emails taking about

4392
02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:57,840
this

4393
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:59,760
talking about the same case maybe my

4394
02:39:57,840 --> 02:40:01,120
level of credibility will increase

4395
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:03,359
because we have multiple people that

4396
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:04,640
have seen exactly the same kind of thing

4397
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:07,120
so in this case i will have those kind

4398
02:40:04,639 --> 02:40:07,920
of information there again it's it's a

4399
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:10,0
9607.12 --> 9610
way to

4400
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:12,639
really contextualize information and the

4401
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:15,760
9610 --> 9615.76
quality of the information

4402
02:40:12,639 --> 02:40:17,599
and you have for example

4403
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:19,760
additional one like for example we have

4404
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:22,720
one called estimative language

4405
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:23,520
so this one is more coming from dna and

4406
02:40:22,719 --> 02:40:25,599
the cias

4407
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:27,439
it's like the likelihood of probability

4408
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:28,960
that this happen

4409
02:40:27,439 --> 02:40:30,720
so we can say that this one has been

4410
02:40:28,959 --> 02:40:31,599
almost certain and then we can even

4411
02:40:30,719 --> 02:40:34,639
qualify

4412
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:36,880
or own an analytic judgment on this

4413
02:40:34,639 --> 02:40:37,680
and i can say that it was like quickly

4414
02:40:36,879 --> 02:40:39,920
done and it's

4415
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:40,880
not perfect i will just say low for

4416
02:40:39,920 --> 02:40:42,318
example

4417
02:40:40,879 --> 02:40:43,920
so then you can have this kind of

4418
02:40:42,318 --> 02:40:46,318
information and you can

4419
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:48,159
either use it as an even level again or

4420
02:40:46,318 --> 02:40:50,0
9646.319 --> 9650
a specific review so for example if one

4421
02:40:48,159 --> 02:40:52,239
of the emails it was like

4422
02:40:50,0 --> 02:40:54,159
9650 --> 9654.16
not properly collected or it was skirts

4423
02:40:52,239 --> 02:40:55,840
or someone modified leather and so on

4424
02:40:54,159 --> 02:40:58,959
maybe you can reduce

4425
02:40:55,840 --> 02:41:00,0
9655.84 --> 9660
the summative language of the confidence

4426
02:40:58,959 --> 02:41:02,0
9658.96 --> 9662
level that you have

4427
02:41:00,0 --> 02:41:03,359
9660 --> 9663.359
in the analytic judgment of the specific

4428
02:41:02,0 --> 02:41:06,79
9662 --> 9666.08
evidence or element

4429
02:41:03,359 --> 02:41:06,960
by tagging that at attribute level so

4430
02:41:06,79 --> 02:41:08,239
again

4431
02:41:06,959 --> 02:41:10,0
9666.96 --> 9670
those kind of information that we are

4432
02:41:08,239 --> 02:41:10,639
putting there are factors and so on are

4433
02:41:10,0 --> 02:41:12,799
9670 --> 9672.8
more like

4434
02:41:10,639 --> 02:41:15,199
even level but if you have really

4435
02:41:12,799 --> 02:41:17,278
specific things that need to be changed

4436
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:19,439
or that are specific to the attribute or

4437
02:41:17,279 --> 02:41:24,239
object then you can

4438
02:41:19,439 --> 02:41:24,239
change it in the at the absolute level

4439
02:41:26,79 --> 02:41:29,200
just some other thing on the user

4440
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:31,120
interface that might be useful too that

4441
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:33,520
we skipped

4442
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:35,840
on the metadata of the event you have

4443
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:37,359
plenty of information there

4444
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:39,359
why that is interesting regarding

4445
02:41:37,359 --> 02:41:40,960
organization only and distribution

4446
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:42,399
in this case we just distribute to the

4447
02:41:40,959 --> 02:41:44,239
organization but

4448
02:41:42,398 --> 02:41:45,920
if you have pretty large even at some

4449
02:41:44,239 --> 02:41:47,760
point in time and you want to distribute

4450
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:49,359
you have this kind of overview there

4451
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:51,40
which is helping you to

4452
02:41:49,359 --> 02:41:53,359
see at which level you share this

4453
02:41:51,40 --> 02:41:55,200
information in this case it's super easy

4454
02:41:53,359 --> 02:41:56,960
we just distribute it to the training

4455
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:58,960
organization that's fine

4456
02:41:56,959 --> 02:42:00,879
but if you have a pretty large instance

4457
02:41:58,959 --> 02:42:02,959
with a lot of organization and so on

4458
02:42:00,879 --> 02:42:04,719
it will display you a full graph of

4459
02:42:02,959 --> 02:42:07,759
where the information will flow

4460
02:42:04,719 --> 02:42:07,760
and will be distributed

4461
02:42:08,478 --> 02:42:12,239
okay now going back to our event uh

4462
02:42:11,439 --> 02:42:13,840
basically

4463
02:42:12,239 --> 02:42:15,520
the reason why we went so deeply into

4464
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:16,318
the contextualization part is looking at

4465
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:20,0
9735.52 --> 9740
this event

4466
02:42:16,318 --> 02:42:21,680
we can already uh use this right away

4467
02:42:20,0 --> 02:42:22,639
9740 --> 9742.64
when feeding our tools when doing our

4468
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:24,159
searches

4469
02:42:22,639 --> 02:42:25,760
to basically search for anything

4470
02:42:24,159 --> 02:42:26,478
targeting the financial sector for

4471
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:29,439
example

4472
02:42:26,478 --> 02:42:30,159
we can search for anything related to

4473
02:42:29,439 --> 02:42:33,359
phishing

4474
02:42:30,159 --> 02:42:35,119
and find the data contained in this

4475
02:42:33,359 --> 02:42:37,600
particular event so this already helps

4476
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:41,40
us with our filtering mechanisms

4477
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:42,960
as for pap and tlp those

4478
02:42:41,40 --> 02:42:45,120
tags we can use when we make decisions

4479
02:42:42,959 --> 02:42:47,438
on which tools we feed

4480
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:49,279
the data to or which partners we share

4481
02:42:47,439 --> 02:42:49,840
the information within the case of tlp

4482
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:51,200
so

4483
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:52,719
we're going to see that more tomorrow

4484
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:54,319
when we're creating synchronization

4485
02:42:52,719 --> 02:42:57,278
links with other instances

4486
02:42:54,318 --> 02:42:57,920
we can for example set restrictions on

4487
02:42:57,279 --> 02:43:00,79
tlp

4488
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:01,600
when we're pushing data to another node

4489
02:43:00,79 --> 02:43:04,159
and we can say okay

4490
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:06,0
9781.6 --> 9786
no matter what distribution setting

4491
02:43:04,159 --> 02:43:07,520
don't send anything tlp amber in this

4492
02:43:06,0 --> 02:43:09,439
9786 --> 9789.439
direction for example

4493
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:11,279
yeah as an example as an example there's

4494
02:43:09,439 --> 02:43:12,398
a very good open source tool um called

4495
02:43:11,279 --> 02:43:15,520
the hive

4496
02:43:12,398 --> 02:43:17,119
for serending and they use pap to

4497
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:19,120
know which kind of actions they can do

4498
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:22,560
on the data so if you synchronize them

4499
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:25,680
with the hive instance you can

4500
02:43:22,559 --> 02:43:28,318
really be sure that what you set

4501
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:29,120
as pep for example red on the lisp

4502
02:43:28,318 --> 02:43:30,959
instance

4503
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:33,120
will not generate issues when you are

4504
02:43:30,959 --> 02:43:35,438
starting to expansion within

4505
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:37,359
cortex on the ice to be sure that the

4506
02:43:35,439 --> 02:43:40,559
information is not basically flowing

4507
02:43:37,359 --> 02:43:42,880
somewhere else so at this point

4508
02:43:40,559 --> 02:43:43,840
something that we didn't do so far is we

4509
02:43:42,879 --> 02:43:45,839
did not include the

4510
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:47,680
on the initial email so what we're going

4511
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:48,960
to do now is we're going to use another

4512
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:51,200
functionality of this that we haven't

4513
02:43:48,959 --> 02:43:54,79
talked much about called the report

4514
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:55,760
the event report we can also include

4515
02:43:54,79 --> 02:43:58,639
clear text

4516
02:43:55,760 --> 02:44:00,398
information such as a report description

4517
02:43:58,639 --> 02:44:01,599
and so on together with the event

4518
02:44:00,398 --> 02:44:03,439
so what we're going to do now is

4519
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:05,200
something very simple we're not going to

4520
02:44:03,439 --> 02:44:06,720
write our own report we have a report

4521
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:07,439
already available from the original

4522
02:44:06,719 --> 02:44:09,119
source

4523
02:44:07,439 --> 02:44:11,439
so we're just going to paste that entire

4524
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:11,439
email

4525
02:44:14,398 --> 02:44:19,840
okay just submit for now

4526
02:44:21,579 --> 02:44:24,770
[Music]

4527
02:44:26,239 --> 02:44:29,920
so now if you look at our email

4528
02:44:30,318 --> 02:44:34,0
9870.319 --> 9874
report we just have a simple report

4529
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:35,359
during gear text we're going to see an

4530
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:36,879
9874 --> 9876.88
example what you can do with this so

4531
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:39,359
this is all in markdown

4532
02:44:36,879 --> 02:44:41,438
so you could go into edit mode and

4533
02:44:39,359 --> 02:44:41,920
pretty it up add additional information

4534
02:44:41,439 --> 02:44:43,600
there

4535
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:45,40
we're not going to do that now because

4536
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:46,0
9883.6 --> 9886
we're going to just look at an example

4537
02:44:45,40 --> 02:44:47,920
that already has that

4538
02:44:46,0 --> 02:44:49,520
9886 --> 9889.52
but before we do that let's get back to

4539
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:51,279
our event and let's assume that we're

4540
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:51,680
done with it with this entire process we

4541
02:44:51,279 --> 02:44:53,520
have our

4542
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:54,800
report we have our event we have

4543
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:56,560
contextualized all

4544
02:44:54,799 --> 02:44:57,920
our data and let's publish it now to the

4545
02:44:56,559 --> 02:44:59,840
community

4546
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:01,520
so when it comes to publishing we have

4547
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:05,120
different uh

4548
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:06,720
uh ways of achieving that ms by default

4549
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:08,640
when we create an event like this at

4550
02:45:06,719 --> 02:45:10,159
this stage we have all the data

4551
02:45:08,639 --> 02:45:11,439
contained that we want to share out and

4552
02:45:10,159 --> 02:45:13,520
that we want to use

4553
02:45:11,439 --> 02:45:14,639
however misconsiders this to be

4554
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:17,279
non-final

4555
02:45:14,639 --> 02:45:19,358
it is not to be used by automation tools

4556
02:45:17,279 --> 02:45:20,960
connected to this

4557
02:45:19,359 --> 02:45:22,479
it is not going to be synchronized out

4558
02:45:20,959 --> 02:45:25,759
to other instances

4559
02:45:22,478 --> 02:45:28,959
and uh and so on

4560
02:45:25,760 --> 02:45:31,279
what we can do now is first of all

4561
02:45:28,959 --> 02:45:34,318
we need to decide how we shared it out

4562
02:45:31,279 --> 02:45:35,840
it is the organization only for now

4563
02:45:34,318 --> 02:45:38,639
so even if we were to publish it it

4564
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:40,719
would still only be pushed to our own

4565
02:45:38,639 --> 02:45:42,239
tools that connect to our miss but it

4566
02:45:40,719 --> 02:45:44,159
would not be made visible to other

4567
02:45:42,239 --> 02:45:45,119
organizations but we want to change this

4568
02:45:44,159 --> 02:45:48,0
9944.16 --> 9948
in this case

4569
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:49,520
however let's assume that uh that when

4570
02:45:48,0 --> 02:45:52,398
9948 --> 9952.399
we're an organization

4571
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:53,840
that does not wish to reveal who we uh

4572
02:45:52,398 --> 02:45:56,159
that we were involved in

4573
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:58,239
in this entire incident we just want to

4574
02:45:56,159 --> 02:46:00,318
entrust the third party with doing it

4575
02:45:58,239 --> 02:46:01,600
so as you see there where alex is

4576
02:46:00,318 --> 02:46:02,318
hovering we basically have several

4577
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:03,840
options here

4578
02:46:02,318 --> 02:46:06,559
we can either publish the event which

4579
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:08,79
means we initiate the entire exchange

4580
02:46:06,559 --> 02:46:10,559
with other instances if the

4581
02:46:08,79 --> 02:46:12,159
distribution allows it it will it will

4582
02:46:10,559 --> 02:46:12,719
alert everyone that we have published

4583
02:46:12,159 --> 02:46:14,799
this

4584
02:46:12,719 --> 02:46:16,478
or alternatively we can we can delegate

4585
02:46:14,799 --> 02:46:18,159
the publishing to third party and stay

4586
02:46:16,478 --> 02:46:20,879
anonymous ourselves so let's do that

4587
02:46:18,159 --> 02:46:22,159
option for now

4588
02:46:20,879 --> 02:46:24,0
9980.88 --> 9984
so what we're doing now is we're

4589
02:46:22,159 --> 02:46:26,478
entrusting a third party to take over

4590
02:46:24,0 --> 02:46:28,559
9984 --> 9988.56
this event for us so let's say that we

4591
02:46:26,478 --> 02:46:30,478
would entrust for example circle to take

4592
02:46:28,559 --> 02:46:32,398
over this event

4593
02:46:30,478 --> 02:46:34,79
and we tell circle that we want to share

4594
02:46:32,398 --> 02:46:36,840
this event to be shared with

4595
02:46:34,79 --> 02:46:39,840
uh the entire community so we've

4596
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:39,840
collected

4597
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:49,359
yeah you can see this community only for

4598
02:46:47,359 --> 02:46:50,840
example or a sharing group whatever you

4599
02:46:49,359 --> 02:46:53,520
prefer

4600
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:55,279
okay so this is again a suggestion to

4601
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:56,960
the other organization saying okay we

4602
02:46:55,279 --> 02:46:57,760
want you to share this out and we want

4603
02:46:56,959 --> 02:47:00,959
you to share this

4604
02:46:57,760 --> 02:47:02,0
10017.76 --> 10022
to this community once we click yes

4605
02:47:00,959 --> 02:47:04,0
10020.96 --> 10024
even though the event was your

4606
02:47:02,0 --> 02:47:05,439
10022 --> 10025.439
organizational and only visible to us

4607
02:47:04,0 --> 02:47:07,680
10024 --> 10027.68
it now becomes visible to two

4608
02:47:05,439 --> 02:47:08,960
organizations ourselves

4609
02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:10,720
and the other organization that we

4610
02:47:08,959 --> 02:47:12,0
10028.96 --> 10032
entrust in this case circle so circle

4611
02:47:10,719 --> 02:47:14,318
would get an email

4612
02:47:12,0 --> 02:47:16,79
10032 --> 10036.08
saying okay there's this delegation

4613
02:47:14,318 --> 02:47:17,119
request someone wants you to take over

4614
02:47:16,79 --> 02:47:18,398
their event

4615
02:47:17,120 --> 02:47:19,920
are you willing to take it over and

4616
02:47:18,398 --> 02:47:21,199
publish it under your name this will

4617
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:23,120
look something like this with slightly

4618
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:25,920
different text we're cheating here now

4619
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:27,600
since we're doing a training we're site

4620
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:28,478
administrators and we see both sides of

4621
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:30,239
the story

4622
02:47:28,478 --> 02:47:31,599
so we can either accept or discard this

4623
02:47:30,239 --> 02:47:33,920
request keep in mind

4624
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:35,200
if you accept such a request the event

4625
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:38,559
becomes your event

4626
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:40,960
a copy of it is created under your name

4627
02:47:38,559 --> 02:47:42,639
and basically you are taking

4628
02:47:40,959 --> 02:47:44,239
responsibility for the event from down

4629
02:47:42,639 --> 02:47:46,719
so also make sure that you're not

4630
02:47:44,239 --> 02:47:49,39
pushing junk under your name so in this

4631
02:47:46,719 --> 02:47:50,799
case let's just discard it

4632
02:47:49,40 --> 02:47:53,920
but we could have accepted it and then

4633
02:47:50,799 --> 02:47:57,358
it would have become our event

4634
02:47:53,920 --> 02:47:57,359
okay let's go back to the event

4635
02:48:00,79 --> 02:48:04,719
okay so now the other alternative is if

4636
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:06,240
you want to publish it under our name

4637
02:48:04,719 --> 02:48:07,840
what you would need to do is you would

4638
02:48:06,239 --> 02:48:08,398
need to raise the distribution level

4639
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:10,639
first

4640
02:48:08,398 --> 02:48:11,599
if you wanted to uh to involve any other

4641
02:48:10,639 --> 02:48:13,39
parties

4642
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:15,680
so we need to edit the event in that

4643
02:48:13,40 --> 02:48:18,240
case and raise the distribution level to

4644
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:19,439
say this community or connected

4645
02:48:18,239 --> 02:48:20,318
communities let's go with connected

4646
02:48:19,439 --> 02:48:22,639
communities

4647
02:48:20,318 --> 02:48:24,639
connected communities means anyone that

4648
02:48:22,639 --> 02:48:26,478
has access to my miss pinsons

4649
02:48:24,639 --> 02:48:28,478
and all the directly interconnected

4650
02:48:26,478 --> 02:48:29,199
instances including all their members as

4651
02:48:28,478 --> 02:48:32,478
well

4652
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:33,920
so in the case for example

4653
02:48:32,478 --> 02:48:36,239
of us publishing something like this in

4654
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:37,439
the first instance we as circle have our

4655
02:48:36,239 --> 02:48:39,439
instance connected to it

4656
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:40,960
so all the members of the circle

4657
02:48:39,439 --> 02:48:42,800
instance will automatically also be

4658
02:48:40,959 --> 02:48:46,79
included in the exchange here we see a

4659
02:48:42,799 --> 02:48:47,759
graph of that so we see the event would

4660
02:48:46,79 --> 02:48:49,279
be also visible to all the directly

4661
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:51,120
connected instances

4662
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:53,40
which we only have one of which is a

4663
02:48:51,120 --> 02:48:56,640
loopback

4664
02:48:53,40 --> 02:48:57,520
connection to exchange so not that

4665
02:48:56,639 --> 02:48:59,119
interesting

4666
02:48:57,520 --> 02:49:00,960
and to everyone that has access to this

4667
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:04,160
current instance

4668
02:49:00,959 --> 02:49:04,639
okay once we're done we can click

4669
02:49:04,159 --> 02:49:08,159
publish

4670
02:49:04,639 --> 02:49:08,159
and then the event gets synchronized

4671
02:49:08,639 --> 02:49:12,0
10148.64 --> 10152
so what happens at this stage is first

4672
02:49:10,639 --> 02:49:14,799
of all the event will jump

4673
02:49:12,0 --> 02:49:16,559
10152 --> 10156.56
over to directly connected instances

4674
02:49:14,799 --> 02:49:18,239
miss will send out a bunch of emails to

4675
02:49:16,559 --> 02:49:20,559
everyone that subscribes to

4676
02:49:18,239 --> 02:49:22,959
publish alerts that there is a new event

4677
02:49:20,559 --> 02:49:25,760
with all the data contained within

4678
02:49:22,959 --> 02:49:27,759
it will push the event down various

4679
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:32,478
local channels to other tools

4680
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:34,0
10167.76 --> 10174
using xeromq kafka and so on and syslog

4681
02:49:32,478 --> 02:49:35,679
so if you have any tools that are

4682
02:49:34,0 --> 02:49:37,600
10174 --> 10177.6
subscribed to these

4683
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:38,800
published feeds and they will ingest the

4684
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:40,559
data

4685
02:49:38,799 --> 02:49:42,478
and it will also make it available to

4686
02:49:40,559 --> 02:49:44,0
10180.56 --> 10184
the api and to make it available to all

4687
02:49:42,478 --> 02:49:47,119
the integration

4688
02:49:44,0 --> 02:49:49,359
10184 --> 10189.359
tools out there so if you have your

4689
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:51,359
your scene connected to miss it will now

4690
02:49:49,359 --> 02:49:54,559
be able to fetch the data

4691
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:55,200
contained in this event so this is

4692
02:49:54,559 --> 02:49:57,600
basically

4693
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:58,319
the publishing process however there is

4694
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:00,79
uh

4695
02:49:58,318 --> 02:50:01,840
if at this point we noticed that okay

4696
02:50:00,79 --> 02:50:03,600
we've now shared this event out

4697
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:06,840
but we've actually made a typo in the

4698
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:10,0
10203.6 --> 10210
title we we wanted to include

4699
02:50:06,840 --> 02:50:13,760
uh um i don't know

4700
02:50:10,0 --> 02:50:16,239
10210 --> 10216.24
a trailing period at the end of the

4701
02:50:13,760 --> 02:50:16,239
sentence

4702
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:23,279
in the title and we edit the event what

4703
02:50:21,439 --> 02:50:24,639
happens now is there is a modification

4704
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:26,800
to the event so even though it was

4705
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:30,79
published it becomes unpublished again

4706
02:50:26,799 --> 02:50:31,920
and it needs to be to be republished now

4707
02:50:30,79 --> 02:50:33,760
the reason why we do this is

4708
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:37,680
uh whenever there is a change we need to

4709
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:39,920
synchronize it out to

4710
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:40,720
and if you have a publishing process in

4711
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:42,478
place where

4712
02:50:40,719 --> 02:50:44,159
so only certain users have access to

4713
02:50:42,478 --> 02:50:45,760
publishing rights for example

4714
02:50:44,159 --> 02:50:47,359
then anytime your organization is

4715
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:49,120
pushing out information

4716
02:50:47,359 --> 02:50:50,800
it can go through the irregular vetting

4717
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:52,319
process so any change will unset the

4718
02:50:50,799 --> 02:50:54,318
publishing of the event

4719
02:50:52,318 --> 02:50:55,840
now in this case this is a very small

4720
02:50:54,318 --> 02:50:57,519
change that we've made so we don't want

4721
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:59,920
to actually send out events to all their

4722
02:50:57,520 --> 02:51:03,40
users we don't want to spam them with

4723
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:03,920
data that is pretty relevant for them so

4724
02:51:03,40 --> 02:51:05,520
we can publish

4725
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:09,279
do the publishing again but this time

4726
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:11,40
using the publish no email option

4727
02:51:09,279 --> 02:51:12,640
so it will also synchronize the data it

4728
02:51:11,40 --> 02:51:13,439
will again make it available to all

4729
02:51:12,639 --> 02:51:16,318
different

4730
02:51:13,439 --> 02:51:19,600
means of ingesting the data but it will

4731
02:51:16,318 --> 02:51:22,159
not spam our users with emails

4732
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:23,120
okay so that's basically it for the

4733
02:51:22,159 --> 02:51:24,398
publishing

4734
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:26,399
and perhaps one thing that is

4735
02:51:24,398 --> 02:51:27,680
interesting and that we didn't talk much

4736
02:51:26,398 --> 02:51:29,119
about is

4737
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:30,479
we have now raised the distribution

4738
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:31,520
level of this event to connected

4739
02:51:30,478 --> 02:51:34,79
communities

4740
02:51:31,520 --> 02:51:35,439
so the event is synchronized out but we

4741
02:51:34,79 --> 02:51:36,398
actually had an attribute if you look

4742
02:51:35,439 --> 02:51:37,760
further down

4743
02:51:36,398 --> 02:51:40,398
that's had a different distribution

4744
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:41,840
level uh so that one is actually going

4745
02:51:40,398 --> 02:51:43,39
to be removed from the synchronized

4746
02:51:41,840 --> 02:51:45,520
button

4747
02:51:43,40 --> 02:51:49,279
uh so we had one that the the

4748
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:49,279
impersonated person's email address

4749
02:51:49,359 --> 02:51:52,0
10309.359 --> 10312
that was set to organization only so

4750
02:51:51,40 --> 02:51:53,120
whenever we're talking about

4751
02:51:52,0 --> 02:51:54,639
10312 --> 10314.64
synchronization

4752
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:56,479
that thing will in this case not

4753
02:51:54,639 --> 02:51:59,39
synchronize out so that will be redacted

4754
02:51:56,478 --> 02:51:59,39
from the event

4755
02:51:59,279 --> 02:52:03,680
okay something else that we can do at

4756
02:52:02,239 --> 02:52:05,520
this point once we have created our

4757
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:06,960
event is we can also extract it in

4758
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:09,40
different formats so if you click on

4759
02:52:06,959 --> 02:52:10,398
download s on the left side

4760
02:52:09,40 --> 02:52:12,80
you will see that we can basically

4761
02:52:10,398 --> 02:52:13,519
convert this automatically to a bunch of

4762
02:52:12,79 --> 02:52:14,799
different formats and extract it in

4763
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:16,560
those formats directly

4764
02:52:14,799 --> 02:52:18,639
this is also what we would be accessing

4765
02:52:16,559 --> 02:52:20,959
by the api if you were to search for

4766
02:52:18,639 --> 02:52:23,519
this event we can also mark whatever

4767
02:52:20,959 --> 02:52:25,199
response format we want just very

4768
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:26,560
briefly we won't go very deeply into

4769
02:52:25,200 --> 02:52:30,0
10345.2 --> 10350
this these formats

4770
02:52:26,559 --> 02:52:31,600
are coming partially from our predefined

4771
02:52:30,0 --> 02:52:33,520
10350 --> 10353.52
hard-coded list of formats that we

4772
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:35,600
support in miss

4773
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:36,800
but some of these formats also come from

4774
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:40,0
10355.6 --> 10360
the different exp

4775
02:52:36,799 --> 02:52:41,920
export modules that we have so if you

4776
02:52:40,0 --> 02:52:43,439
10360 --> 10363.439
want you can either build your own

4777
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:44,799
native modules for exporting and

4778
02:52:43,439 --> 02:52:47,840
converting data

4779
02:52:44,799 --> 02:52:50,159
or you can build modules

4780
02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:51,279
that are sitting in another tool called

4781
02:52:50,159 --> 02:52:53,39
miss modules

4782
02:52:51,279 --> 02:52:54,560
side by side with mist that will ingest

4783
02:52:53,40 --> 02:52:55,439
the data and then convert it to other

4784
02:52:54,559 --> 02:52:58,159
formats

4785
02:52:55,439 --> 02:53:00,0
10375.439 --> 10380
so here's a pdf report that was created

4786
02:52:58,159 --> 02:53:03,439
directly out of the event

4787
02:53:00,0 --> 02:53:05,680
10380 --> 10385.68
uh and that you can just

4788
02:53:03,439 --> 02:53:07,40
share out directly from the event

4789
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:09,600
something else that you can do

4790
02:53:07,40 --> 02:53:11,520
is uh anything that we do in misp so all

4791
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:13,760
the process of adding attributes

4792
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:14,720
all the process of viewing data you can

4793
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:16,478
also do uh

4794
02:53:14,719 --> 02:53:18,318
so do that in a machine partial way by

4795
02:53:16,478 --> 02:53:19,920
just spending.json at the end of any of

4796
02:53:18,318 --> 02:53:21,278
the url

4797
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:23,120
so in that case in this event we're

4798
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:23,680
going to get the json representation of

4799
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:27,760
the

4800
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:27,760
event okay

4801
02:53:28,79 --> 02:53:32,318
so that's basically for creating an

4802
02:53:30,0 --> 02:53:32,318
10410 --> 10412.319
event

4803
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:36,720
just maybe one thing that is interesting

4804
02:53:35,40 --> 02:53:40,80
we have a very good question from

4805
02:53:36,719 --> 02:53:43,119
martin it's a

4806
02:53:40,79 --> 02:53:46,239
quite complex one but maybe we can

4807
02:53:43,120 --> 02:53:49,520
already partially answer it

4808
02:53:46,239 --> 02:53:50,959
so when you create an event and in this

4809
02:53:49,520 --> 02:53:54,79
case a creator or

4810
02:53:50,959 --> 02:53:55,199
is the training people can contribute on

4811
02:53:54,79 --> 02:53:57,680
that one

4812
02:53:55,200 --> 02:53:59,520
but if you have an isaac and you want to

4813
02:53:57,680 --> 02:54:00,318
distribute back the information and so

4814
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:02,560
on

4815
02:54:00,318 --> 02:54:04,559
one of the options that you have is to

4816
02:54:02,559 --> 02:54:05,760
try to create extended events for

4817
02:54:04,559 --> 02:54:08,879
example out of it

4818
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:10,398
so you can um out of an event you can

4819
02:54:08,879 --> 02:54:13,358
create a new one

4820
02:54:10,398 --> 02:54:14,478
um which would be for example with

4821
02:54:13,359 --> 02:54:18,0
10453.359 --> 10458
additional information

4822
02:54:14,478 --> 02:54:18,959
like validations uh additional things

4823
02:54:18,0 --> 02:54:21,520
10458 --> 10461.52
that you want you

4824
02:54:18,959 --> 02:54:22,799
you want to add so you have this kind of

4825
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:24,159
extend even and you will create

4826
02:54:22,799 --> 02:54:27,358
automatically a

4827
02:54:24,159 --> 02:54:33,920
new event based on that

4828
02:54:27,359 --> 02:54:34,800
um thing that is interesting there um

4829
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:36,559
the

4830
02:54:34,799 --> 02:54:38,398
the thing is you can really create

4831
02:54:36,559 --> 02:54:40,398
something completely new

4832
02:54:38,398 --> 02:54:42,239
out of it and then see so for example

4833
02:54:40,398 --> 02:54:45,358
for this case i can say that we

4834
02:54:42,239 --> 02:54:47,279
uh we did a kind of session with

4835
02:54:45,359 --> 02:54:50,0
10485.359 --> 10490
additional information

4836
02:54:47,279 --> 02:54:52,960
um there the distribution is your

4837
02:54:50,0 --> 02:54:52,959
10490 --> 10492.96
organization only

4838
02:54:53,120 --> 02:54:57,680
and i would add for example a specific

4839
02:54:55,600 --> 02:55:02,159
attribute

4840
02:54:57,680 --> 02:55:05,600
which is for example targeting data

4841
02:55:02,159 --> 02:55:09,359
and i can say target user uh the son

4842
02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:11,439
of the prime minister

4843
02:55:09,359 --> 02:55:12,479
so it may be information that you really

4844
02:55:11,439 --> 02:55:16,159
don't want to share

4845
02:55:12,478 --> 02:55:18,159
with others so this one is basically

4846
02:55:16,159 --> 02:55:19,200
a normal event with additional

4847
02:55:18,159 --> 02:55:21,760
information there

4848
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:24,79
and it's only shared within your

4849
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:26,239
organization

4850
02:55:24,79 --> 02:55:27,600
nevertheless if you go to the original

4851
02:55:26,239 --> 02:55:29,119
event

4852
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:31,279
you have this kind of extended view

4853
02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:35,279
there and we can have

4854
02:55:31,279 --> 02:55:38,560
what we call an extended view and not an

4855
02:55:35,279 --> 02:55:41,600
atomic view and the two information

4856
02:55:38,559 --> 02:55:43,760
so the is combined and you can see there

4857
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:46,159
that we have one with the information

4858
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:49,760
about the son of the prime minister

4859
02:55:46,159 --> 02:55:52,478
which is the extended event there so

4860
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:53,200
just to answer the question of martin

4861
02:55:52,478 --> 02:55:56,559
about

4862
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:58,880
the question about

4863
02:55:56,559 --> 02:56:00,239
adding information on existing event is

4864
02:55:58,879 --> 02:56:03,278
one way of doing it

4865
02:56:00,239 --> 02:56:05,840
so using extended event is a way to

4866
02:56:03,279 --> 02:56:07,200
qualify or extend even with additional

4867
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:09,600
information and so on

4868
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:10,479
um it's actively used for example for

4869
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:12,559
when you have

4870
02:56:10,478 --> 02:56:14,318
two different view of the information

4871
02:56:12,559 --> 02:56:15,519
because one is distributed and another

4872
02:56:14,318 --> 02:56:17,920
one is like

4873
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:19,120
likely like the private information like

4874
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:21,120
the forensic evidence

4875
02:56:19,120 --> 02:56:22,800
that you cannot share for example you

4876
02:56:21,120 --> 02:56:24,399
can create this kind of thing

4877
02:56:22,799 --> 02:56:25,599
it's one way of doing it it's not

4878
02:56:24,398 --> 02:56:26,959
answering companies the question of

4879
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:29,439
martin but we can

4880
02:56:26,959 --> 02:56:31,358
even go deeper later on that but it's

4881
02:56:29,439 --> 02:56:32,559
it's one way of

4882
02:56:31,359 --> 02:56:34,559
because tomorrow we talk about

4883
02:56:32,559 --> 02:56:36,0
10592.56 --> 10596
synchronization there are some specific

4884
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:37,920
options for isaac like

4885
02:56:36,0 --> 02:56:39,359
10596 --> 10599.359
and publishing events if we do

4886
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:41,439
synchronization and so on

4887
02:56:39,359 --> 02:56:43,200
that can be used in some some cases for

4888
02:56:41,439 --> 02:56:45,520
isaac's

4889
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:47,760
there are many options but that's one

4890
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:50,319
way of of partially solving

4891
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:51,279
this kind of issues of not owning the

4892
02:56:50,318 --> 02:56:55,600
data

4893
02:56:51,279 --> 02:56:57,359
is to extend the information

4894
02:56:55,600 --> 02:56:59,200
so i know you have something you want to

4895
02:56:57,359 --> 02:57:02,640
add on rashford

4896
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:02,640
no no that makes sense

4897
02:57:04,239 --> 02:57:08,639
again for the collaboration on this one

4898
02:57:07,40 --> 02:57:11,279
we can do various things so

4899
02:57:08,639 --> 02:57:13,760
in the case of um you have a typo for

4900
02:57:11,279 --> 02:57:15,920
example in the specifications and so on

4901
02:57:13,760 --> 02:57:17,439
you can make proposal another thing with

4902
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:19,920
uh

4903
02:57:17,439 --> 02:57:21,120
on the interface here you see that you

4904
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:23,680
can

4905
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:24,880
basically make either an edit or you see

4906
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:28,398
that you can make

4907
02:57:24,879 --> 02:57:28,879
a proposed edit so what is the use case

4908
02:57:28,398 --> 02:57:30,719
of that

4909
02:57:28,879 --> 02:57:32,398
it's it's not like for fundamental

4910
02:57:30,719 --> 02:57:34,959
changes but for i would say minor

4911
02:57:32,398 --> 02:57:37,119
challenges on a specific import

4912
02:57:34,959 --> 02:57:38,879
imagine that you don't agree on this one

4913
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:42,720
on this idea of season

4914
02:57:38,879 --> 02:57:46,398
there's a typo and it's not d5 but e5

4915
02:57:42,719 --> 02:57:48,639
in the ipv6 rs so you propose the change

4916
02:57:46,398 --> 02:57:49,680
in this case i'm playing both holes here

4917
02:57:48,639 --> 02:57:51,920
but

4918
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:53,120
what do i have here it's basically an

4919
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:55,520
attribute

4920
02:57:53,120 --> 02:57:56,800
with a proposal of the church and i'm

4921
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:59,439
playing the boss roles for the

4922
02:57:56,799 --> 02:58:02,799
contributor roles and

4923
02:57:59,439 --> 02:58:05,760
the original creator then i can say okay

4924
02:58:02,799 --> 02:58:07,679
i accept the change indeed this this

4925
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:10,960
proposal makes sense

4926
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:14,0
10687.68 --> 10694
or are basically discounted and this is

4927
02:58:10,959 --> 02:58:18,0
10690.96 --> 10698
a way to get updates from

4928
02:58:14,0 --> 02:58:19,439
10694 --> 10699.439
um from supportive other members other

4929
02:58:18,0 --> 02:58:21,40
10698 --> 10701.04
organizations and so on

4930
02:58:19,439 --> 02:58:22,880
it's one way to to update the

4931
02:58:21,40 --> 02:58:26,960
information in this case i will

4932
02:58:22,879 --> 02:58:28,879
discuss it because it's not correct

4933
02:58:26,959 --> 02:58:30,879
we were talking about contributions this

4934
02:58:28,879 --> 02:58:32,79
another way of contributing is the site

4935
02:58:30,879 --> 02:58:35,679
things itself

4936
02:58:32,79 --> 02:58:37,39
so for example for this specifications

4937
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:38,398
if for example we have an expression

4938
02:58:37,40 --> 02:58:39,40
detection system and we have seen it

4939
02:58:38,398 --> 02:58:42,719
like

4940
02:58:39,40 --> 02:58:47,279
three times in a row we can add

4941
02:58:42,719 --> 02:58:48,639
on on the interface with the api

4942
02:58:47,279 --> 02:58:50,640
through the user interface and so on

4943
02:58:48,639 --> 02:58:53,920
that you have seen that um

4944
02:58:50,639 --> 02:58:55,920
multiple times and like that you can

4945
02:58:53,920 --> 02:58:59,200
share this kind of details about

4946
02:58:55,920 --> 02:59:01,200
the sharing aspect

4947
02:58:59,200 --> 02:59:02,800
so we what we have seen that at this

4948
02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:05,359
specific amount of times we have

4949
02:59:02,799 --> 02:59:06,239
the three counts saying this uh this is

4950
02:59:05,359 --> 02:59:07,920
a site

4951
02:59:06,239 --> 02:59:09,520
and you have seen it and you can do it

4952
02:59:07,920 --> 02:59:11,840
per organization

4953
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:13,439
or it could be even anonymously you get

4954
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:15,439
different configuration in the model of

4955
02:59:13,439 --> 02:59:18,159
cycling in mist

4956
02:59:15,439 --> 02:59:19,279
but it's a way to see that an indicator

4957
02:59:18,159 --> 02:59:22,799
has been seen

4958
02:59:19,279 --> 02:59:23,680
or not if one specific are generating

4959
02:59:22,799 --> 02:59:25,599
for example a

4960
02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:28,318
false positive you can see the negative

4961
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:30,960
one negative sightings which

4962
02:59:28,318 --> 02:59:33,840
basically tell others that okay this one

4963
02:59:30,959 --> 02:59:35,839
is generating a lot of false positives

4964
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:37,200
sometimes not every organization agrees

4965
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:38,719
on the first positive because they have

4966
02:59:37,200 --> 02:59:40,800
different views

4967
02:59:38,719 --> 02:59:42,799
coming from different networks and so on

4968
02:59:40,799 --> 02:59:46,318
that's a way to

4969
02:59:42,799 --> 02:59:49,358
provide feedback so one is delegations

4970
02:59:46,318 --> 02:59:57,519
proposals or another way is to

4971
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:59,760
basically get affected

4972
02:59:57,520 --> 02:59:59,760
okay

4973
03:00:01,439 --> 03:00:04,479
i'm just trying to go through the

4974
03:00:02,719 --> 03:00:07,278
questions yeah

4975
03:00:04,478 --> 03:00:08,478
maybe yes maybe there are some yeah

4976
03:00:07,279 --> 03:00:10,560
there are some that are repeating so

4977
03:00:08,478 --> 03:00:12,799
perhaps it's good to call them out

4978
03:00:10,559 --> 03:00:13,680
uh so there was a bit of confusion about

4979
03:00:12,799 --> 03:00:16,0
10812.8 --> 10816
how to add the

4980
03:00:13,680 --> 03:00:17,40
uh the email object so it uh checked it

4981
03:00:16,0 --> 03:00:19,200
10816 --> 10819.2
is a little bit

4982
03:00:17,40 --> 03:00:20,880
uh confusing so when you're in an event

4983
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:22,960
and you click on add objects first you

4984
03:00:20,879 --> 03:00:24,559
need to select the scope

4985
03:00:22,959 --> 03:00:26,478
from which you choose from so it's going

4986
03:00:24,559 --> 03:00:28,559
to be climate file and so on just click

4987
03:00:26,478 --> 03:00:30,159
on all objects if you're unsure

4988
03:00:28,559 --> 03:00:31,680
and then you can search for whatever so

4989
03:00:30,159 --> 03:00:32,398
after you click on all objects and you

4990
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:35,920
type email

4991
03:00:32,398 --> 03:00:38,0
10832.399 --> 10838
it's going to show your email object

4992
03:00:35,920 --> 03:00:39,520
here the first step is more like finding

4993
03:00:38,0 --> 03:00:41,680
10838 --> 10841.68
out the category of an object

4994
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:43,200
yeah so so some sometimes you just know

4995
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:44,880
the category but you don't know what is

4996
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:46,800
really available there for you

4997
03:00:44,879 --> 03:00:48,719
so you you want to see okay what sort of

4998
03:00:46,799 --> 03:00:50,398
objects can i use in network contacts

4999
03:00:48,719 --> 03:00:52,799
and i would click on network first

5000
03:00:50,398 --> 03:00:54,159
and then you get a list of of all

5001
03:00:52,799 --> 03:00:55,438
tangently related

5002
03:00:54,159 --> 03:00:57,279
objects that will have to do with

5003
03:00:55,439 --> 03:01:00,159
network connectivity but

5004
03:00:57,279 --> 03:01:01,520
not necessarily describing the same

5005
03:01:00,159 --> 03:01:04,639
concept at all

5006
03:01:01,520 --> 03:01:06,319
uh but if you don't know or

5007
03:01:04,639 --> 03:01:08,239
which the domain you want to pick it

5008
03:01:06,318 --> 03:01:10,0
10866.319 --> 10870
from or if you know

5009
03:01:08,239 --> 03:01:11,600
exactly already what you want and you

5010
03:01:10,0 --> 03:01:13,120
10870 --> 10873.12
just want to search by name just click

5011
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:14,159
on all objects first

5012
03:01:13,120 --> 03:01:17,680
and then you will find what you're

5013
03:01:14,159 --> 03:01:20,879
looking for by just typing it so email

5014
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:25,40
is easy to find that way

5015
03:01:20,879 --> 03:01:25,39
okay so just type email and that's it

5016
03:01:25,359 --> 03:01:33,359
okay um other questions

5017
03:01:28,639 --> 03:01:35,920
that were there okay perfect

5018
03:01:33,359 --> 03:01:37,359
and there there were a few other

5019
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:38,398
questions that i answered in the

5020
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:41,40
meanwhile maybe it's

5021
03:01:38,398 --> 03:01:42,318
a good idea to read soft about yeah

5022
03:01:41,40 --> 03:01:44,240
indeed there was a good one

5023
03:01:42,318 --> 03:01:45,680
about correlation graph and and

5024
03:01:44,239 --> 03:01:47,199
filtering on it

5025
03:01:45,680 --> 03:01:49,40
indeed we don't have a way to filter the

5026
03:01:47,200 --> 03:01:50,479
correlation graph but it's something

5027
03:01:49,40 --> 03:01:52,0
10909.04 --> 10912
that we that we've discussed for a while

5028
03:01:50,478 --> 03:01:52,398
already and we want to do it at one

5029
03:01:52,0 --> 03:01:54,79
10912 --> 10914.08
point

5030
03:01:52,398 --> 03:01:56,0
10912.399 --> 10916
so that you can add some filter rules in

5031
03:01:54,79 --> 03:01:58,79
there yes

5032
03:01:56,0 --> 03:01:59,760
10916 --> 10919.76
the only way to to do it here at least

5033
03:01:58,79 --> 03:02:01,39
through the api so that means you you

5034
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:03,840
done the

5035
03:02:01,40 --> 03:02:04,640
decorating one and then you have to do a

5036
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:07,279
filtering

5037
03:02:04,639 --> 03:02:07,920
priority but it needs something that's

5038
03:02:07,279 --> 03:02:11,279
uh

5039
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:12,719
yeah it will be to be added i don't know

5040
03:02:11,279 --> 03:02:17,40
if you have an issue on that one

5041
03:02:12,719 --> 03:02:19,199
um yeah i think we do yes yes

5042
03:02:17,40 --> 03:02:21,760
so maybe you know what sometimes what we

5043
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:21,760
do is

5044
03:02:21,840 --> 03:02:26,159
just just to add the one on this one um

5045
03:02:24,559 --> 03:02:27,359
if i'm finding his back

5046
03:02:26,159 --> 03:02:29,359
so i guess you can see what kind of

5047
03:02:27,359 --> 03:02:31,40
issue that we have and so on

5048
03:02:29,359 --> 03:02:32,880
a lot of the issue that we have is more

5049
03:02:31,40 --> 03:02:34,960
like i mean

5050
03:02:32,879 --> 03:02:36,318
around 25 percent 30 percent our basic

5051
03:02:34,959 --> 03:02:38,719
installation problem

5052
03:02:36,318 --> 03:02:39,920
um that's something that you can discuss

5053
03:02:38,719 --> 03:02:42,559
maybe tomorrow about

5054
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:43,359
about recommendation on on on the

5055
03:02:42,559 --> 03:02:45,199
systems

5056
03:02:43,359 --> 03:02:46,559
we don't need a lot of requirements but

5057
03:02:45,200 --> 03:02:48,240
at least um

5058
03:02:46,559 --> 03:02:49,760
you need to have a lamp system working

5059
03:02:48,239 --> 03:02:52,879
for mariadb

5060
03:02:49,760 --> 03:02:56,318
linux systems and ready running

5061
03:02:52,879 --> 03:02:57,759
so obviously for example an ubuntu

5062
03:02:56,318 --> 03:02:59,439
distribution out of the box is working

5063
03:02:57,760 --> 03:03:02,79
without any problems

5064
03:02:59,439 --> 03:03:02,800
now if you try to install a missponder

5065
03:03:02,79 --> 03:03:05,359
mac os

5066
03:03:02,799 --> 03:03:05,920
you might turn into troubles obviously

5067
03:03:05,359 --> 03:03:07,920
but

5068
03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:09,840
what we recommend is we have install

5069
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:12,159
automatic install script for

5070
03:03:09,840 --> 03:03:14,239
for ubuntu for example and this one

5071
03:03:12,159 --> 03:03:18,239
works works quite well

5072
03:03:14,239 --> 03:03:18,239
i wanted to search the issue for

5073
03:03:18,398 --> 03:03:22,559
you just search your correlation for

5074
03:03:20,79 --> 03:03:25,840
correlation yeah

5075
03:03:22,559 --> 03:03:26,239
creation filtering now that will be a

5076
03:03:25,840 --> 03:03:29,279
bit

5077
03:03:26,239 --> 03:03:31,439
too specific i think no really not

5078
03:03:29,279 --> 03:03:40,640
maybe yes we're filtering by correlation

5079
03:03:31,439 --> 03:03:43,520
on feedback

5080
03:03:40,639 --> 03:03:43,519
yeah that's easy

5081
03:03:44,719 --> 03:03:55,840
oh this one maybe yes yeah yeah okay

5082
03:03:47,840 --> 03:03:55,840
this one okay so

5083
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:06,960
so that's how we work so if you see a

5084
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:08,560
component issue that

5085
03:04:06,959 --> 03:04:10,239
or a feature that is really interesting

5086
03:04:08,559 --> 03:04:11,359
for you don't hesitate to take an

5087
03:04:10,239 --> 03:04:13,600
existing issue

5088
03:04:11,359 --> 03:04:14,479
about specific requests and add some

5089
03:04:13,600 --> 03:04:16,318
comments there

5090
03:04:14,478 --> 03:04:18,0
11054.479 --> 11058
like for example it's really the issue

5091
03:04:16,318 --> 03:04:20,159
the feature that you want

5092
03:04:18,0 --> 03:04:22,79
11058 --> 11062.08
uh is it important for you why and so on

5093
03:04:20,159 --> 03:04:25,200
and then we use that as a source of

5094
03:04:22,79 --> 03:04:26,959
of doing a pd request as an example we

5095
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:29,40
do

5096
03:04:26,959 --> 03:04:30,559
a release of miss every three weeks

5097
03:04:29,40 --> 03:04:34,560
usually

5098
03:04:30,559 --> 03:04:35,359
and there are many new features on each

5099
03:04:34,559 --> 03:04:38,398
release

5100
03:04:35,359 --> 03:04:40,318
as an example we had a request like that

5101
03:04:38,398 --> 03:04:43,599
sami just fixed uh

5102
03:04:40,318 --> 03:04:44,559
two days ago about the events oh we

5103
03:04:43,600 --> 03:04:48,640
didn't even show it

5104
03:04:44,559 --> 03:04:50,398
even timeline and then

5105
03:04:48,639 --> 03:04:52,159
we wanted to have something that is easy

5106
03:04:50,398 --> 03:04:52,478
to set the number of days and then he

5107
03:04:52,159 --> 03:04:54,719
has

5108
03:04:52,478 --> 03:04:56,318
the new feature so sometimes it makes a

5109
03:04:54,719 --> 03:04:57,39
lot of sense so don't hesitate to create

5110
03:04:56,318 --> 03:05:00,79
a

5111
03:04:57,40 --> 03:05:01,359
an issue and and propose a new new

5112
03:05:00,79 --> 03:05:05,600
feature

5113
03:05:01,359 --> 03:05:08,79
which remind me of showing you the even

5114
03:05:05,600 --> 03:05:09,520
timeline because we didn't really show

5115
03:05:08,79 --> 03:05:13,359
it

5116
03:05:09,520 --> 03:05:17,840
so you see that on on this one

5117
03:05:13,359 --> 03:05:20,239
we we have nearly everything

5118
03:05:17,840 --> 03:05:21,120
same time which is basically the time

5119
03:05:20,239 --> 03:05:24,79
when we

5120
03:05:21,120 --> 03:05:27,760
create a different object we just set

5121
03:05:24,79 --> 03:05:31,439
the time for four for one

5122
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:33,120
so and then i can

5123
03:05:31,439 --> 03:05:35,120
basically look at this one and this one

5124
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:37,760
is like the

5125
03:05:35,120 --> 03:05:40,319
yeah i don't know why we don't have the

5126
03:05:37,760 --> 03:05:41,600
expansion on that one

5127
03:05:40,318 --> 03:05:43,359
so for you for example if you have a

5128
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:44,960
specific time we can

5129
03:05:43,359 --> 03:05:46,318
expand it and even change it in the

5130
03:05:44,959 --> 03:05:47,679
graph so that means if we have for

5131
03:05:46,318 --> 03:05:50,559
example this email

5132
03:05:47,680 --> 03:05:51,120
a thing with that we can we can expand

5133
03:05:50,559 --> 03:05:54,0
11150.56 --> 11154
it

5134
03:05:51,120 --> 03:05:56,240
and change when when this has been seen

5135
03:05:54,0 --> 03:05:58,559
11154 --> 11158.56
and we can even uh

5136
03:05:56,239 --> 03:06:00,239
change at which time this specific

5137
03:05:58,559 --> 03:06:04,79
specifically

5138
03:06:00,239 --> 03:06:07,439
but that's again a good point to do

5139
03:06:04,79 --> 03:06:10,959
is to automatically create

5140
03:06:07,439 --> 03:06:13,200
a first thing last scene on your element

5141
03:06:10,959 --> 03:06:14,959
because every time you do that you will

5142
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:16,880
get an automatic timeline

5143
03:06:14,959 --> 03:06:20,478
and actually a quick i would say quick

5144
03:06:16,879 --> 03:06:20,478
win when you do analysis

5145
03:06:21,510 --> 03:06:25,439
[Music]

5146
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:27,120
so if there are no more questions about

5147
03:06:25,439 --> 03:06:28,800
event creation perhaps one of the things

5148
03:06:27,120 --> 03:06:33,200
we can do is show the searching

5149
03:06:28,799 --> 03:06:33,199
how to search for stuff in your risk

5150
03:06:36,398 --> 03:06:40,239
okay so this is something that we're

5151
03:06:38,799 --> 03:06:42,398
going to show very briefly now and we're

5152
03:06:40,239 --> 03:06:43,199
going to go a bit more detail into this

5153
03:06:42,398 --> 03:06:44,959
tomorrow

5154
03:06:43,200 --> 03:06:47,40
when we're also going to look at the api

5155
03:06:44,959 --> 03:06:47,679
but generally whenever you're searching

5156
03:06:47,40 --> 03:06:49,40
in miss

5157
03:06:47,680 --> 03:06:50,800
the main question you need to ask

5158
03:06:49,40 --> 03:06:52,960
yourself is

5159
03:06:50,799 --> 03:06:54,719
what scope am i searching on am i

5160
03:06:52,959 --> 03:06:56,879
searching for individual attributes

5161
03:06:54,719 --> 03:06:58,559
or am i searching for events the search

5162
03:06:56,879 --> 03:07:01,278
filters very often overlapping

5163
03:06:58,559 --> 03:07:02,318
or aren't necessarily almost the same

5164
03:07:01,279 --> 03:07:04,79
but one of the things you need to keep

5165
03:07:02,318 --> 03:07:04,398
in mind is for example if i'm searching

5166
03:07:04,79 --> 03:07:06,879
for

5167
03:07:04,398 --> 03:07:09,39
bitcoin addresses in my miss vincent's

5168
03:07:06,879 --> 03:07:11,278
bitcoin wallets

5169
03:07:09,40 --> 03:07:12,640
am i searching for any event that

5170
03:07:11,279 --> 03:07:16,0
11231.279 --> 11236
contains at least one

5171
03:07:12,639 --> 03:07:18,239
bitcoin address or am i searching for

5172
03:07:16,0 --> 03:07:19,920
11236 --> 11239.92
just the bitcoin addresses themselves

5173
03:07:18,239 --> 03:07:21,439
so this is when we decide between

5174
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:23,520
different scopes so

5175
03:07:21,439 --> 03:07:25,200
generally attribute scope will only give

5176
03:07:23,520 --> 03:07:26,399
you the individual attributes that match

5177
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:27,840
the criteria

5178
03:07:26,398 --> 03:07:29,439
and the event scope will give you

5179
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:32,239
everything that contains

5180
03:07:29,439 --> 03:07:34,318
at least one matching value so here what

5181
03:07:32,239 --> 03:07:36,639
what alex did he just searched

5182
03:07:34,318 --> 03:07:37,760
using the attribute search for all the

5183
03:07:36,639 --> 03:07:39,519
bitcoin addresses

5184
03:07:37,760 --> 03:07:40,880
in the air in the instance and we see we

5185
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:42,560
get a bunch of them from different

5186
03:07:40,879 --> 03:07:44,559
sources we see which events there

5187
03:07:42,559 --> 03:07:46,239
they're from which organization has

5188
03:07:44,559 --> 03:07:47,439
created that information and so on and

5189
03:07:46,239 --> 03:07:49,199
so forth

5190
03:07:47,439 --> 03:07:51,520
uh if we're happy with the search

5191
03:07:49,200 --> 03:07:53,600
results and we've set up all our

5192
03:07:51,520 --> 03:07:55,120
features and we're getting exactly what

5193
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:57,279
we were looking for

5194
03:07:55,120 --> 03:07:59,120
maybe even several pages of it like here

5195
03:07:57,279 --> 03:08:01,200
we can download the results in any of

5196
03:07:59,120 --> 03:08:02,640
these supported formats so we could say

5197
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:04,560
okay now we have all these bitcoin

5198
03:08:02,639 --> 03:08:05,278
addresses out there generate the csv out

5199
03:08:04,559 --> 03:08:08,398
of it

5200
03:08:05,279 --> 03:08:10,640
and it will generate a massive csv

5201
03:08:08,398 --> 03:08:13,199
with all the attribute information for

5202
03:08:10,639 --> 03:08:13,199
each of these

5203
03:08:13,840 --> 03:08:18,559
i hope you're not running my timings

5204
03:08:15,760 --> 03:08:18,559
inside of memory

5205
03:08:19,520 --> 03:08:23,120
there it is

5206
03:08:21,760 --> 03:08:26,159
[Music]

5207
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:28,0
11303.12 --> 11308
so if you open it just to see the

5208
03:08:26,159 --> 03:08:31,279
results quickly

5209
03:08:28,0 --> 03:08:34,159
11308 --> 11314.16
there we go so in this case uh

5210
03:08:31,279 --> 03:08:34,960
we now downloaded our search results as

5211
03:08:34,159 --> 03:08:36,559
csv

5212
03:08:34,959 --> 03:08:39,119
now keep in mind whenever you're dealing

5213
03:08:36,559 --> 03:08:39,439
with integration of mis with other tools

5214
03:08:39,120 --> 03:08:41,439
or

5215
03:08:39,439 --> 03:08:43,680
exports keep in mind that certain

5216
03:08:41,439 --> 03:08:45,200
formats don't really cater to exporting

5217
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:47,600
certain types of data so

5218
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:49,439
if you're searching for ransomware

5219
03:08:47,600 --> 03:08:51,920
payout

5220
03:08:49,439 --> 03:08:52,800
wallets you could for example specify as

5221
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:55,120
a tag

5222
03:08:52,799 --> 03:08:56,398
all the different ransomware related

5223
03:08:55,120 --> 03:08:58,880
tags that you have

5224
03:08:56,398 --> 03:09:00,559
and uh as a type select btc like what

5225
03:08:58,879 --> 03:09:02,239
alex has done here and exported

5226
03:09:00,559 --> 03:09:03,920
information now when you're deciding

5227
03:09:02,239 --> 03:09:05,760
what format to download in

5228
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:07,920
again some don't make any sense so don't

5229
03:09:05,760 --> 03:09:10,239
download bitcoin addresses in sticks

5230
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:11,920
format because sticks doesn't have a

5231
03:09:10,239 --> 03:09:13,359
way to express bitcoin addresses for

5232
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:15,439
example

5233
03:09:13,359 --> 03:09:17,120
so just make sure that you also take

5234
03:09:15,439 --> 03:09:19,760
that into consideration and exporting

5235
03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:22,160
data so that it's not wasting

5236
03:09:19,760 --> 03:09:23,680
uh besides that we can do the same on

5237
03:09:22,159 --> 03:09:24,559
the event level we can also do searches

5238
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:26,800
on the event level

5239
03:09:24,559 --> 03:09:29,39
if we go back to our event index we have

5240
03:09:26,799 --> 03:09:29,358
a little magnifying glass icon where you

5241
03:09:29,40 --> 03:09:31,600
can

5242
03:09:29,359 --> 03:09:32,479
add additional filter options to the

5243
03:09:31,600 --> 03:09:34,720
index

5244
03:09:32,478 --> 03:09:35,519
and filter the database on that so let's

5245
03:09:34,719 --> 03:09:38,159
just do

5246
03:09:35,520 --> 03:09:39,520
simple we're going to just filter on

5247
03:09:38,159 --> 03:09:41,200
events coming from circle

5248
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:42,960
and we can also add for example events

5249
03:09:41,200 --> 03:09:45,439
that are not published

5250
03:09:42,959 --> 03:09:47,358
if you wanted to do some final checks on

5251
03:09:45,439 --> 03:09:50,960
whether

5252
03:09:47,359 --> 03:09:52,399
uh we need to add the organization again

5253
03:09:50,959 --> 03:09:54,79
whether we have any events that need to

5254
03:09:52,398 --> 03:09:55,840
be vetted for example for our own

5255
03:09:54,79 --> 03:09:57,39
organization then we could use this

5256
03:09:55,840 --> 03:09:58,799
filter for it

5257
03:09:57,40 --> 03:10:00,479
on the event index all of these search

5258
03:09:58,799 --> 03:10:02,559
filters that you apply

5259
03:10:00,478 --> 03:10:03,519
generate a specific url and you can

5260
03:10:02,559 --> 03:10:05,359
bookmark it

5261
03:10:03,520 --> 03:10:06,560
so if you have recurring queries that

5262
03:10:05,359 --> 03:10:08,399
you want to monitor

5263
03:10:06,559 --> 03:10:09,680
then you can just bookmark the url and

5264
03:10:08,398 --> 03:10:11,358
you can go back to it

5265
03:10:09,680 --> 03:10:12,960
later on and see if there is anything

5266
03:10:11,359 --> 03:10:16,880
that popped up that matches your

5267
03:10:12,959 --> 03:10:19,839
search criteria now generally

5268
03:10:16,879 --> 03:10:21,199
like i think 90 of our searches do not

5269
03:10:19,840 --> 03:10:23,600
actually happen via the ui

5270
03:10:21,200 --> 03:10:25,200
they happen via the api so very often

5271
03:10:23,600 --> 03:10:26,79
you have tools that you search through

5272
03:10:25,200 --> 03:10:28,479
so if you have a

5273
03:10:26,79 --> 03:10:30,238
tool that acts as a front-end for your

5274
03:10:28,478 --> 03:10:32,0
11428.479 --> 11432
miss for certain searches that works as

5275
03:10:30,238 --> 03:10:33,439
well

5276
03:10:32,0 --> 03:10:34,959
11432 --> 11434.96
we're going to talk more about those

5277
03:10:33,439 --> 03:10:37,120
type of searches and how you integrate

5278
03:10:34,959 --> 03:10:39,599
with other tools tomorrow more

5279
03:10:37,120 --> 03:10:41,279
when we go into the api a bit is a

5280
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:42,960
question about soft delete attribute

5281
03:10:41,279 --> 03:10:45,600
search

5282
03:10:42,959 --> 03:10:47,199
i just lost the q and a so some martin

5283
03:10:45,600 --> 03:10:48,559
asks is there a way to do a global

5284
03:10:47,200 --> 03:10:51,840
search for software

5285
03:10:48,559 --> 03:10:54,318
attributes yes sorry where is it

5286
03:10:51,840 --> 03:10:56,478
there for software attachments yes there

5287
03:10:54,318 --> 03:10:59,359
is

5288
03:10:56,478 --> 03:11:00,879
uh so not via the ui but via the api uh

5289
03:10:59,359 --> 03:11:02,238
which you can also access

5290
03:11:00,879 --> 03:11:03,759
by the way we have two we have a

5291
03:11:02,238 --> 03:11:04,799
built-in tool we can even show it show

5292
03:11:03,760 --> 03:11:08,639
this example there

5293
03:11:04,799 --> 03:11:08,639
we didn't show the delete i

5294
03:11:10,639 --> 03:11:15,39
and let's start with the question first

5295
03:11:12,639 --> 03:11:16,639
and then we go to the delete

5296
03:11:15,40 --> 03:11:18,560
so we have this built-in tool called the

5297
03:11:16,639 --> 03:11:22,478
rest client that allows us to run

5298
03:11:18,559 --> 03:11:24,318
searches directly from the interface so

5299
03:11:22,478 --> 03:11:26,0
11482.479 --> 11486
generally indeed we have a software

5300
03:11:24,318 --> 03:11:29,119
delete mechanism in bisp

5301
03:11:26,0 --> 03:11:30,79
11486 --> 11490.08
that allows you to to not fully remove

5302
03:11:29,120 --> 03:11:32,239
an attribute but

5303
03:11:30,79 --> 03:11:33,920
mark is for it for deletion the reason

5304
03:11:32,238 --> 03:11:36,159
why we do this in general is

5305
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:37,439
whenever we're synchronizing information

5306
03:11:36,159 --> 03:11:38,799
and we delete an attribute

5307
03:11:37,439 --> 03:11:40,880
we want to inform all the leather

5308
03:11:38,799 --> 03:11:42,159
instances attribute needs to be removed

5309
03:11:40,879 --> 03:11:44,238
it is revoked

5310
03:11:42,159 --> 03:11:45,680
so this is why we do the soft delete

5311
03:11:44,238 --> 03:11:48,478
when we hide it from the interface

5312
03:11:45,680 --> 03:11:50,639
behind it from the exports

5313
03:11:48,478 --> 03:11:52,0
11508.479 --> 11512
but we still keep the data and we inform

5314
03:11:50,639 --> 03:11:54,0
11510.64 --> 11514
the other instances that they need to

5315
03:11:52,0 --> 03:11:57,120
11512 --> 11517.12
also market for deletion

5316
03:11:54,0 --> 03:11:58,799
11514 --> 11518.8
now if the question is how do we do a

5317
03:11:57,120 --> 03:12:00,319
global search for all the soft deleted

5318
03:11:58,799 --> 03:12:00,799
attributes so first of all what we need

5319
03:12:00,318 --> 03:12:04,478
to do

5320
03:12:00,799 --> 03:12:06,799
yeah using our little research too

5321
03:12:04,478 --> 03:12:08,719
is by the way we have the modern apis

5322
03:12:06,799 --> 03:12:11,438
here to create a new api unless you know

5323
03:12:08,719 --> 03:12:11,438
yours by heart

5324
03:12:12,0 --> 03:12:17,200
11532 --> 11537.2
so alex because you it's very good

5325
03:12:17,359 --> 03:12:20,479
so so just quickly that's so uh so in

5326
03:12:19,439 --> 03:12:22,318
the meanwhile what

5327
03:12:20,478 --> 03:12:24,238
alex is doing now is uh he's going to

5328
03:12:22,318 --> 03:12:26,959
generate a new api key for himself

5329
03:12:24,238 --> 03:12:29,359
so that we can actually test the api uh

5330
03:12:26,959 --> 03:12:33,839
queries

5331
03:12:29,359 --> 03:12:33,840
oh that's one word yeah

5332
03:12:35,279 --> 03:12:47,840
yeah you can add enough key from here as

5333
03:12:36,719 --> 03:12:47,840
well this will work yeah that works

5334
03:12:54,129 --> 03:12:57,279
[Music]

5335
03:12:59,680 --> 03:13:16,238
a global action my profile by the way if

5336
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:16,238
you want to find your profile okay

5337
03:13:17,359 --> 03:13:21,760
so now we have our api key now we go to

5338
03:13:20,159 --> 03:13:22,398
rest client we just paste it in there

5339
03:13:21,760 --> 03:13:25,680
now

5340
03:13:22,398 --> 03:13:25,680
in the authorization field

5341
03:13:27,439 --> 03:13:30,639
here we go and now what we're going to

5342
03:13:28,799 --> 03:13:32,79
do is we're going to uh to run a search

5343
03:13:30,639 --> 03:13:32,478
for all software attributes so we're

5344
03:13:32,79 --> 03:13:35,680
going to

5345
03:13:32,478 --> 03:13:37,519
search for attribute rest search so that

5346
03:13:35,680 --> 03:13:38,960
is a scope that allows us to search on

5347
03:13:37,520 --> 03:13:41,120
the attribute level we'll do we'll see

5348
03:13:38,959 --> 03:13:44,0
11618.96 --> 11624
more of this tomorrow

5349
03:13:41,120 --> 03:13:47,600
just a small example for return format

5350
03:13:44,0 --> 03:13:47,600
11624 --> 11627.6
let's pick something like json

5351
03:13:53,520 --> 03:13:59,520
and perhaps set a page under limit or

5352
03:13:56,719 --> 03:14:01,119
date one limit 100 or something like

5353
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:02,479
that

5354
03:14:01,120 --> 03:14:04,640
i don't know how much was deleted here

5355
03:14:02,478 --> 03:14:07,199
but it might be a lot and uh

5356
03:14:04,639 --> 03:14:11,840
then just uh add another key deleted

5357
03:14:07,200 --> 03:14:11,840
there we go

5358
03:14:12,159 --> 03:14:15,439
and then deleted september

5359
03:14:16,398 --> 03:14:19,680
and we don't need anything else

5360
03:14:20,318 --> 03:14:24,478
and this will return the first 100 hits

5361
03:14:23,279 --> 03:14:28,238
from the instance

5362
03:14:24,478 --> 03:14:28,238
of attributes that are deleted

5363
03:14:30,398 --> 03:14:35,278
there we go and now if you if you wanted

5364
03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:36,720
to paginate through all these attributes

5365
03:14:35,279 --> 03:14:37,359
you would have to just raise the page

5366
03:14:36,719 --> 03:14:40,0
11676.72 --> 11680
number

5367
03:14:37,359 --> 03:14:40,800
go back and and get page 2 page 3 page 4

5368
03:14:40,0 --> 03:14:42,799
11680 --> 11682.8
and so on

5369
03:14:40,799 --> 03:14:44,959
or if we have enough memory certainly my

5370
03:14:42,799 --> 03:14:46,318
training instance definitely doesn't

5371
03:14:44,959 --> 03:14:49,278
then we could just say give us

5372
03:14:46,318 --> 03:14:49,278
everything in one shot

5373
03:14:49,600 --> 03:14:53,840
okay so i hope that answers your

5374
03:14:52,79 --> 03:14:56,559
question martin

5375
03:14:53,840 --> 03:14:58,559
um there is also a question is there an

5376
03:14:56,559 --> 03:15:01,600
official miss docker image

5377
03:14:58,559 --> 03:15:04,318
um and there are actually several uh

5378
03:15:01,600 --> 03:15:05,439
they're not maintained by us but by

5379
03:15:04,318 --> 03:15:08,0
11704.319 --> 11708
contributors

5380
03:15:05,439 --> 03:15:09,200
that are very active and working closely

5381
03:15:08,0 --> 03:15:11,680
11708 --> 11711.68
with us

5382
03:15:09,200 --> 03:15:13,279
so i've pasted one example in the zoom

5383
03:15:11,680 --> 03:15:14,960
group chat

5384
03:15:13,279 --> 03:15:16,560
i don't know if maybe it's not visible

5385
03:15:14,959 --> 03:15:19,119
to everyone

5386
03:15:16,559 --> 03:15:20,719
i can just drop it as an answer here

5387
03:15:19,120 --> 03:15:24,160
yeah it's better

5388
03:15:20,719 --> 03:15:26,79
so this one is done by cool acid so why

5389
03:15:24,159 --> 03:15:29,600
there are so many docker myths

5390
03:15:26,79 --> 03:15:32,398
that's i think the the

5391
03:15:29,600 --> 03:15:35,200
speciality of docker not everyone agrees

5392
03:15:32,398 --> 03:15:37,760
on a model with docker so there are

5393
03:15:35,200 --> 03:15:39,520
at least as far as i know four or five

5394
03:15:37,760 --> 03:15:41,760
different dockers there's one managed by

5395
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:45,40
dcso one by cool assist

5396
03:15:41,760 --> 03:15:47,359
one by xavier mcpens and one by

5397
03:15:45,40 --> 03:15:48,479
harvard security and i'm sure i'm

5398
03:15:47,359 --> 03:15:51,520
missing some

5399
03:15:48,478 --> 03:15:54,159
um so the thing is um for

5400
03:15:51,520 --> 03:15:55,840
for the docker images it's depending of

5401
03:15:54,159 --> 03:15:57,600
i would say your test

5402
03:15:55,840 --> 03:15:59,439
so have a look at what the different

5403
03:15:57,600 --> 03:16:02,0
11757.6 --> 11762
contributors are doing

5404
03:15:59,439 --> 03:16:02,800
and you'll see that you pick the one

5405
03:16:02,0 --> 03:16:05,200
11762 --> 11765.2
that is

5406
03:16:02,799 --> 03:16:06,159
matching what you really want to do with

5407
03:16:05,200 --> 03:16:08,720
docker

5408
03:16:06,159 --> 03:16:09,359
some are really more separated container

5409
03:16:08,719 --> 03:16:11,199
wise

5410
03:16:09,359 --> 03:16:12,800
some are more like one single container

5411
03:16:11,200 --> 03:16:14,399
with everything um

5412
03:16:12,799 --> 03:16:16,79
again it's a maker of taste and all you

5413
03:16:14,398 --> 03:16:18,398
want to to operate one

5414
03:16:16,79 --> 03:16:19,359
we don't maintain one as this project

5415
03:16:18,398 --> 03:16:21,519
but there are

5416
03:16:19,359 --> 03:16:24,399
some that are under our missed project

5417
03:16:21,520 --> 03:16:24,399
guitar position

5418
03:16:27,200 --> 03:16:33,120
someone is asking about api key to

5419
03:16:29,920 --> 03:16:33,120
invoke cortex analyzer

5420
03:16:33,520 --> 03:16:37,40
for the cortex analyzer it's a separate

5421
03:16:36,398 --> 03:16:40,398
tool set

5422
03:16:37,40 --> 03:16:44,319
of part of of the i've project

5423
03:16:40,398 --> 03:16:46,799
and then you have specific api keys

5424
03:16:44,318 --> 03:16:48,879
cortex extension is like this module so

5425
03:16:46,799 --> 03:16:51,39
it works for the expansion services

5426
03:16:48,879 --> 03:16:52,238
uh beaker full cortex analyzer are not

5427
03:16:51,40 --> 03:16:53,840
supporting

5428
03:16:52,238 --> 03:16:55,600
objects and stuff like that which is the

5429
03:16:53,840 --> 03:16:57,600
case for its modules

5430
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:59,120
so you might have expansion on the

5431
03:16:57,600 --> 03:17:01,120
interface but if you want full-blown

5432
03:16:59,120 --> 03:17:03,520
expansion with relationship and so on

5433
03:17:01,120 --> 03:17:05,359
then you can use these modules a lot of

5434
03:17:03,520 --> 03:17:06,800
organizations are mixing both so you can

5435
03:17:05,359 --> 03:17:09,359
have cortex-enabled and

5436
03:17:06,799 --> 03:17:10,238
it's modulus enabled on the same missed

5437
03:17:09,359 --> 03:17:11,680
instance

5438
03:17:10,238 --> 03:17:13,920
but going back to the question if you

5439
03:17:11,680 --> 03:17:16,159
already have the cortex api encoded in

5440
03:17:13,920 --> 03:17:18,960
your misspen you want to invoke

5441
03:17:16,159 --> 03:17:20,959
a lookup uh through the api through misp

5442
03:17:18,959 --> 03:17:22,238
then you can use your misspik to tell

5443
03:17:20,959 --> 03:17:27,438
your misp to

5444
03:17:22,238 --> 03:17:29,520
run a query against cortex

5445
03:17:27,439 --> 03:17:33,200
but with the new api key models usually

5446
03:17:29,520 --> 03:17:33,200
it's better to have dedicated api

5447
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:42,569
okay um there is something else easy

5448
03:17:39,680 --> 03:17:44,479
you know that we had it already um

5449
03:17:42,569 --> 03:17:46,159
[Music]

5450
03:17:44,478 --> 03:17:48,159
could you touch on how we could use one

5451
03:17:46,159 --> 03:17:50,639
event to add multiple attributes and how

5452
03:17:48,159 --> 03:17:52,398
would correlation work here uh configure

5453
03:17:50,639 --> 03:17:53,358
event one to fetch all records from a

5454
03:17:52,398 --> 03:17:54,799
fishing feed

5455
03:17:53,359 --> 03:17:56,800
would this work with correlation show

5456
03:17:54,799 --> 03:17:58,719
all instances where any of those

5457
03:17:56,799 --> 03:17:59,759
attributes match with other events from

5458
03:17:58,719 --> 03:18:02,799
other organization

5459
03:17:59,760 --> 03:18:03,760
events well okay if i understand it

5460
03:18:02,799 --> 03:18:06,318
correctly indeed

5461
03:18:03,760 --> 03:18:08,318
so if you if you do that you create an

5462
03:18:06,318 --> 03:18:09,920
event for a fishing feed

5463
03:18:08,318 --> 03:18:11,920
and you have those attributes in there

5464
03:18:09,920 --> 03:18:14,879
and you have cross you have cached

5465
03:18:11,920 --> 03:18:16,879
other instances then within that that

5466
03:18:14,879 --> 03:18:17,519
feeds event you will see correlations

5467
03:18:16,879 --> 03:18:19,278
both to

5468
03:18:17,520 --> 03:18:21,359
other events created locally on your

5469
03:18:19,279 --> 03:18:23,359
instance by other organizations

5470
03:18:21,359 --> 03:18:24,720
as well as links to other instances that

5471
03:18:23,359 --> 03:18:26,960
have the

5472
03:18:24,719 --> 03:18:27,760
data as long as you have cached those

5473
03:18:26,959 --> 03:18:29,438
events

5474
03:18:27,760 --> 03:18:31,120
so we're going to talk more about that

5475
03:18:29,439 --> 03:18:31,840
tomorrow about the synchronization but

5476
03:18:31,120 --> 03:18:33,439
when you're

5477
03:18:31,840 --> 03:18:34,880
interconnecting with another instance

5478
03:18:33,439 --> 03:18:36,639
you can do it in two ways

5479
03:18:34,879 --> 03:18:38,398
one i want to start exchanging data

5480
03:18:36,639 --> 03:18:40,639
pushing data pooling data

5481
03:18:38,398 --> 03:18:42,318
or two i can just tell my mist to go

5482
03:18:40,639 --> 03:18:44,799
crawl that other instance

5483
03:18:42,318 --> 03:18:46,559
uh hash all the values that they have

5484
03:18:44,799 --> 03:18:48,559
and if i ever get the correlation

5485
03:18:46,559 --> 03:18:50,79
then it flags it for me that it shows me

5486
03:18:48,559 --> 03:18:52,79
and then that the

5487
03:18:50,79 --> 03:18:54,238
instance already knows about this value

5488
03:18:52,79 --> 03:18:55,920
and i can pivot over to previewing the

5489
03:18:54,238 --> 03:18:58,398
data

5490
03:18:55,920 --> 03:19:00,79
so i hope that answers that yeah and

5491
03:18:58,398 --> 03:19:01,358
then the correlation of

5492
03:19:00,79 --> 03:19:03,600
for example if you just enable the

5493
03:19:01,359 --> 03:19:05,760
caching you just see that it's

5494
03:19:03,600 --> 03:19:08,479
correlating with specific values without

5495
03:19:05,760 --> 03:19:09,279
providing the full fit sometimes it's

5496
03:19:08,478 --> 03:19:11,519
it's quite

5497
03:19:09,279 --> 03:19:13,40
handy when you have for example see that

5498
03:19:11,520 --> 03:19:15,920
you cannot show the data but you can

5499
03:19:13,40 --> 03:19:15,920
show the correlation

5500
03:19:16,159 --> 03:19:19,680
there's another one do you recommend

5501
03:19:17,439 --> 03:19:22,398
using miss palone or using the hive

5502
03:19:19,680 --> 03:19:22,800
miss cortex integration i mean generally

5503
03:19:22,398 --> 03:19:24,478
yeah

5504
03:19:22,799 --> 03:19:26,318
if you need a case management tool then

5505
03:19:24,478 --> 03:19:29,920
then using the hive for that is great

5506
03:19:26,318 --> 03:19:31,439
and so it makes absolute sense to you to

5507
03:19:29,920 --> 03:19:33,920
use them together

5508
03:19:31,439 --> 03:19:34,880
and integration is really smoothly done

5509
03:19:33,920 --> 03:19:36,639
so that means that

5510
03:19:34,879 --> 03:19:38,238
that no matter where you start your your

5511
03:19:36,639 --> 03:19:40,398
process whether you start

5512
03:19:38,238 --> 03:19:41,840
by creating an event in misp or whether

5513
03:19:40,398 --> 03:19:44,79
you start by creating a

5514
03:19:41,840 --> 03:19:46,0
11981.84 --> 11986
case in the hive you can basically

5515
03:19:44,79 --> 03:19:46,639
propagate the data to the other tool and

5516
03:19:46,0 --> 03:19:49,200
11986 --> 11989.2
work on

5517
03:19:46,639 --> 03:19:50,79
on both tools and data so so yeah

5518
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:52,79
absolutely

5519
03:19:50,79 --> 03:19:54,559
yeah absolutely it's pretty smooth just

5520
03:19:52,79 --> 03:19:56,159
just be careful if you use the expansion

5521
03:19:54,559 --> 03:19:58,799
on mist and you have miss modules

5522
03:19:56,159 --> 03:20:00,318
enabled i would prefer to have

5523
03:19:58,799 --> 03:20:03,199
modules enabled because you you

5524
03:20:00,318 --> 03:20:06,318
basically have all the features of mixed

5525
03:20:03,200 --> 03:20:08,159
like relationship objects and so on

5526
03:20:06,318 --> 03:20:09,439
with the cortex integration is basically

5527
03:20:08,159 --> 03:20:11,600
just the over with

5528
03:20:09,439 --> 03:20:12,559
the vortex yeah but one of the things

5529
03:20:11,600 --> 03:20:14,79
that you can do is

5530
03:20:12,559 --> 03:20:16,0
12012.56 --> 12016
if you start for example from the hive

5531
03:20:14,79 --> 03:20:17,279
perspective and you push the data

5532
03:20:16,0 --> 03:20:18,799
12016 --> 12018.8
afterwards to misp

5533
03:20:17,279 --> 03:20:20,640
you can then go through this process

5534
03:20:18,799 --> 03:20:21,759
like what we've done here with enriching

5535
03:20:20,639 --> 03:20:24,159
the information

5536
03:20:21,760 --> 03:20:25,760
creating objects that affect attributes

5537
03:20:24,159 --> 03:20:27,200
so you can do it as a secondary step

5538
03:20:25,760 --> 03:20:28,0
12025.76 --> 12028
before you share it out to community to

5539
03:20:27,200 --> 03:20:30,79
refine the data

5540
03:20:28,0 --> 03:20:31,920
12028 --> 12031.92
in mis that you've created in the i for

5541
03:20:30,79 --> 03:20:33,439
example and the same thing if you've

5542
03:20:31,920 --> 03:20:34,719
used cortex to fetch additional

5543
03:20:33,439 --> 03:20:36,398
information in the hive

5544
03:20:34,719 --> 03:20:38,0
12034.72 --> 12038
you can then take that data and further

5545
03:20:36,398 --> 03:20:38,959
enrich it with miss modules once it's a

5546
03:20:38,0 --> 03:20:40,959
12038 --> 12040.96
message

5547
03:20:38,959 --> 03:20:42,79
yeah this is a good question from

5548
03:20:40,959 --> 03:20:45,278
muammar

5549
03:20:42,79 --> 03:20:47,120
junaid about when i try to import the

5550
03:20:45,279 --> 03:20:49,40
data from six to five it's called

5551
03:20:47,120 --> 03:20:50,880
lazy like can you please explain that a

5552
03:20:49,40 --> 03:20:52,640
bit and this one is interesting

5553
03:20:50,879 --> 03:20:54,398
because it's it's i was saying a long

5554
03:20:52,639 --> 03:20:57,358
long long discussion and that

5555
03:20:54,398 --> 03:21:00,0
12054.399 --> 12060
that's even influence or miss people

5556
03:20:57,359 --> 03:21:03,40
than the standard behind missed

5557
03:21:00,0 --> 03:21:04,0
12060 --> 12064
so sticks is really uh focusing on cyber

5558
03:21:03,40 --> 03:21:07,279
security and

5559
03:21:04,0 --> 03:21:10,318
12064 --> 12070.319
cyber studies religion and

5560
03:21:07,279 --> 03:21:11,920
the the problem is you might have at

5561
03:21:10,318 --> 03:21:13,760
some point in time

5562
03:21:11,920 --> 03:21:15,120
data that are basically not defined

5563
03:21:13,760 --> 03:21:17,760
anywhere

5564
03:21:15,120 --> 03:21:20,160
so it's more for the export of data so

5565
03:21:17,760 --> 03:21:23,40
for example if you export in a mixed

5566
03:21:20,159 --> 03:21:23,439
event and you have for example an object

5567
03:21:23,40 --> 03:21:25,520
with

5568
03:21:23,439 --> 03:21:28,479
the person and stuff like that it won't

5569
03:21:25,520 --> 03:21:31,600
be in the sticks to export for example

5570
03:21:28,478 --> 03:21:33,519
so it means that in misprevent you get

5571
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:35,200
all the information but it's bound to

5572
03:21:33,520 --> 03:21:36,238
the limitation of the standards and the

5573
03:21:35,200 --> 03:21:37,600
format

5574
03:21:36,238 --> 03:21:39,520
where you export and it's exactly the

5575
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:42,238
same for any format i mean if you

5576
03:21:39,520 --> 03:21:43,760
um export a person in theory cata format

5577
03:21:42,238 --> 03:21:46,799
obviously you don't have any

5578
03:21:43,760 --> 03:21:47,600
um field or things like that with person

5579
03:21:46,799 --> 03:21:49,438
and so on so

5580
03:21:47,600 --> 03:21:51,439
that's why we call it losing because uh

5581
03:21:49,439 --> 03:21:55,840
sometimes when you import data

5582
03:21:51,439 --> 03:21:55,840
it's bound to a specific set of

5583
03:21:55,920 --> 03:21:58,960
fields that are supported and so on

5584
03:21:58,0 --> 03:22:01,359
12118 --> 12121.359
another thing that is

5585
03:21:58,959 --> 03:22:02,719
quite important with sticks you might

5586
03:22:01,359 --> 03:22:05,279
have a lot of

5587
03:22:02,719 --> 03:22:06,639
peculiarities or specialities depending

5588
03:22:05,279 --> 03:22:08,479
on the vendor

5589
03:22:06,639 --> 03:22:09,840
some vendors are adding some some

5590
03:22:08,478 --> 03:22:11,679
specific custom objects

5591
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:13,359
things like that that are not bound to

5592
03:22:11,680 --> 03:22:15,600
any existing one

5593
03:22:13,359 --> 03:22:16,960
so we are importing them as kind of you

5594
03:22:15,600 --> 03:22:20,238
know generic one but

5595
03:22:16,959 --> 03:22:22,238
it is basically like uh lucy again so

5596
03:22:20,238 --> 03:22:23,760
you have to be careful when you you use

5597
03:22:22,238 --> 03:22:26,318
a specific format

5598
03:22:23,760 --> 03:22:27,40
to be sure that you properly uh map an

5599
03:22:26,318 --> 03:22:29,199
existing

5600
03:22:27,40 --> 03:22:31,200
different one so it's more for the

5601
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:33,520
export is quite flexible on that so you

5602
03:22:31,200 --> 03:22:36,239
can basically have any object you like

5603
03:22:33,520 --> 03:22:36,880
but when we explore for example in 61 we

5604
03:22:36,238 --> 03:22:39,840
just

5605
03:22:36,879 --> 03:22:41,39
support what is existing in sticks even

5606
03:22:39,840 --> 03:22:43,359
if we start we add

5607
03:22:41,40 --> 03:22:45,840
some some custom objects too which are

5608
03:22:43,359 --> 03:22:47,840
on to the missed object

5609
03:22:45,840 --> 03:22:49,680
but some tools will not recognize

5610
03:22:47,840 --> 03:22:50,79
obviously the custom object because they

5611
03:22:49,680 --> 03:22:52,79
are

5612
03:22:50,79 --> 03:22:53,840
just having a profile for a specific set

5613
03:22:52,79 --> 03:22:56,398
of known uh updates

5614
03:22:53,840 --> 03:22:56,960
yeah i think that's exactly the point uh

5615
03:22:56,398 --> 03:22:58,238
that

5616
03:22:56,959 --> 03:23:00,959
maybe is different from when we

5617
03:22:58,238 --> 03:23:02,0
12178.239 --> 12182
described the text in those import and

5618
03:23:00,959 --> 03:23:04,159
export fields

5619
03:23:02,0 --> 03:23:06,159
12182 --> 12186.16
we say lossy but in reality what we do

5620
03:23:04,159 --> 03:23:07,119
is we do try to capture everything and

5621
03:23:06,159 --> 03:23:08,959
we do try to map

5622
03:23:07,120 --> 03:23:10,479
everything but a lot of it will end up

5623
03:23:08,959 --> 03:23:13,39
in custom objects now

5624
03:23:10,478 --> 03:23:14,959
now what alex mentioned is the problem

5625
03:23:13,40 --> 03:23:16,399
even if we export bitcoin

5626
03:23:14,959 --> 03:23:18,238
addresses for example whenever we're

5627
03:23:16,398 --> 03:23:20,478
pushing in sticks to format

5628
03:23:18,238 --> 03:23:21,359
as custom objects no other two will pick

5629
03:23:20,478 --> 03:23:23,840
up on it because

5630
03:23:21,359 --> 03:23:25,439
it's if we're just using custom objects

5631
03:23:23,840 --> 03:23:27,40
that unless the other two

5632
03:23:25,439 --> 03:23:28,720
specifically looks for them they will

5633
03:23:27,40 --> 03:23:31,120
just either store it as is

5634
03:23:28,719 --> 03:23:32,238
or not know what to do with it yeah and

5635
03:23:31,120 --> 03:23:35,439
that

5636
03:23:32,238 --> 03:23:35,680
that's why we recommend a feed provider

5637
03:23:35,439 --> 03:23:38,79
of

5638
03:23:35,680 --> 03:23:39,40
anderson son to actively support the

5639
03:23:38,79 --> 03:23:41,39
misformat

5640
03:23:39,40 --> 03:23:42,840
then they can they can really impose a

5641
03:23:41,40 --> 03:23:44,239
full set of objects and so that already

5642
03:23:42,840 --> 03:23:46,159
exists

5643
03:23:44,238 --> 03:23:47,760
yeah in some cases however you don't

5644
03:23:46,159 --> 03:23:49,439
really care about having the full set

5645
03:23:47,760 --> 03:23:50,960
and that's where for example specialized

5646
03:23:49,439 --> 03:23:53,40
formats are really cool

5647
03:23:50,959 --> 03:23:55,199
so whenever we're feeding for example an

5648
03:23:53,40 --> 03:23:56,560
ids for example we don't care about

5649
03:23:55,200 --> 03:23:59,359
bitcoin addresses

5650
03:23:56,559 --> 03:23:59,760
so in those cases uh so sticks and misp

5651
03:23:59,359 --> 03:24:04,79
both

5652
03:23:59,760 --> 03:24:05,760
are very expressive uh exchange formats

5653
03:24:04,79 --> 03:24:07,920
but whenever you're dealing with feeding

5654
03:24:05,760 --> 03:24:10,238
tools for example you don't care about

5655
03:24:07,920 --> 03:24:11,200
uh about losing ninety percent even of

5656
03:24:10,238 --> 03:24:13,680
the data set

5657
03:24:11,200 --> 03:24:15,120
as long as you capture those type of

5658
03:24:13,680 --> 03:24:17,680
data points that your tool can

5659
03:24:15,120 --> 03:24:19,40
process in the end so this is why

5660
03:24:17,680 --> 03:24:20,559
generally what we recommend is if you

5661
03:24:19,40 --> 03:24:21,200
have the option for example to export

5662
03:24:20,559 --> 03:24:23,39
data from

5663
03:24:21,200 --> 03:24:24,800
is for your ideas for your scene and so

5664
03:24:23,40 --> 03:24:27,359
on and you have the option between for

5665
03:24:24,799 --> 03:24:29,519
example sticks or snort or surikata

5666
03:24:27,359 --> 03:24:31,279
go with snorter sturikata because

5667
03:24:29,520 --> 03:24:33,760
because those are much more

5668
03:24:31,279 --> 03:24:35,40
uh catering to what your two can

5669
03:24:33,760 --> 03:24:37,200
actually understand

5670
03:24:35,40 --> 03:24:40,80
yeah for example for yards the same you

5671
03:24:37,200 --> 03:24:41,680
prefer to have like a good yara who will

5672
03:24:40,79 --> 03:24:43,279
say that you can run into another

5673
03:24:41,680 --> 03:24:44,0
12281.68 --> 12284
barista or your endpoint protection

5674
03:24:43,279 --> 03:24:46,159
device

5675
03:24:44,0 --> 03:24:49,840
12284 --> 12289.84
and having a generic one that will not

5676
03:24:46,159 --> 03:24:49,840
help you to lose the detection

5677
03:24:52,559 --> 03:24:55,840
other questions

5678
03:24:56,79 --> 03:24:59,120
you already took that one that is there

5679
03:24:58,639 --> 03:25:00,879
it is

5680
03:24:59,120 --> 03:25:03,920
longer i think we took most of them

5681
03:25:00,879 --> 03:25:06,238
unless they missed one

5682
03:25:03,920 --> 03:25:08,398
and yeah perhaps we should show the

5683
03:25:06,238 --> 03:25:09,199
deletions because we we didn't actually

5684
03:25:08,398 --> 03:25:11,760
show it indeed

5685
03:25:09,200 --> 03:25:11,760
yeah exactly

5686
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:17,40
okay oh and now we have some more

5687
03:25:16,79 --> 03:25:20,159
questions

5688
03:25:17,40 --> 03:25:22,479
but we can take those after yeah let's

5689
03:25:20,159 --> 03:25:23,920
quickly show the deletions so if we go

5690
03:25:22,478 --> 03:25:25,199
to an event

5691
03:25:23,920 --> 03:25:27,279
yeah i'll take i'll take a hundred

5692
03:25:25,200 --> 03:25:30,800
members so this is a massive

5693
03:25:27,279 --> 03:25:32,319
gotcha basic basically missed

5694
03:25:30,799 --> 03:25:33,840
uh which we have some protective

5695
03:25:32,318 --> 03:25:34,799
measures in place to avoid this but one

5696
03:25:33,840 --> 03:25:37,439
of the things that you really need to

5697
03:25:34,799 --> 03:25:39,759
watch out for is

5698
03:25:37,439 --> 03:25:40,479
when you when you add data to misspen

5699
03:25:39,760 --> 03:25:42,398
you notice

5700
03:25:40,478 --> 03:25:44,238
oh crap i should not have added a piece

5701
03:25:42,398 --> 03:25:45,920
of information that is

5702
03:25:44,238 --> 03:25:47,359
either confidential information

5703
03:25:45,920 --> 03:25:49,520
information about the victim that i

5704
03:25:47,359 --> 03:25:51,760
should share and so on

5705
03:25:49,520 --> 03:25:53,279
the attribute that attribute might still

5706
03:25:51,760 --> 03:25:55,200
be contained in the event in a

5707
03:25:53,279 --> 03:25:57,200
in a soft deleted format you can always

5708
03:25:55,200 --> 03:26:00,319
toggle and see the deleted attributes

5709
03:25:57,200 --> 03:26:00,319
uh within an event

5710
03:26:00,879 --> 03:26:05,39
so i will create i will create an even

5711
03:26:02,559 --> 03:26:05,39
from scratch

5712
03:26:05,840 --> 03:26:10,799
okay so before i move forward on that so

5713
03:26:09,200 --> 03:26:13,120
we have two protective measures in place

5714
03:26:10,799 --> 03:26:16,799
to avoid accidental information leakage

5715
03:26:13,120 --> 03:26:18,479
violation one is basically that

5716
03:26:16,799 --> 03:26:20,318
that by default we do not use the

5717
03:26:18,478 --> 03:26:21,519
software method for anything that was

5718
03:26:20,318 --> 03:26:23,519
unpublished uh

5719
03:26:21,520 --> 03:26:24,960
at first so we're going to show it as an

5720
03:26:23,520 --> 03:26:25,760
example so here's some sensitive

5721
03:26:24,959 --> 03:26:27,599
information

5722
03:26:25,760 --> 03:26:30,559
if alex were to delete this now this

5723
03:26:27,600 --> 03:26:32,720
attribute this would get our deleted

5724
03:26:30,559 --> 03:26:33,920
so this will not create a soft deletion

5725
03:26:32,719 --> 03:26:35,760
uh miss pareto

5726
03:26:33,920 --> 03:26:37,200
tells us are you sure you want to hard

5727
03:26:35,760 --> 03:26:38,318
delete the attribute so when you read

5728
03:26:37,200 --> 03:26:40,79
the text you will see the see the

5729
03:26:38,318 --> 03:26:42,0
12398.319 --> 12402
difference there in the wording

5730
03:26:40,79 --> 03:26:43,520
uh the reason for that is the event it

5731
03:26:42,0 --> 03:26:44,879
12402 --> 12404.88
has not been published yet we know that

5732
03:26:43,520 --> 03:26:46,79
it has not probably been propagated to

5733
03:26:44,879 --> 03:26:48,0
12404.88 --> 12408
other instances

5734
03:26:46,79 --> 03:26:50,318
there is absolutely no reason to inform

5735
03:26:48,0 --> 03:26:52,159
12408 --> 12412.16
anyone that this has been deleted

5736
03:26:50,318 --> 03:26:54,559
so we can immediately just hard delete

5737
03:26:52,159 --> 03:26:56,559
it so when we do that

5738
03:26:54,559 --> 03:26:58,238
it will get hard deleted however if the

5739
03:26:56,559 --> 03:26:59,840
event has already been published

5740
03:26:58,238 --> 03:27:01,760
this has already been shared out to

5741
03:26:59,840 --> 03:27:03,920
other instances potentially

5742
03:27:01,760 --> 03:27:05,439
so in this case if we were to delete it

5743
03:27:03,920 --> 03:27:06,799
miss will tell us oh

5744
03:27:05,439 --> 03:27:08,720
are you sure you want to soft delete

5745
03:27:06,799 --> 03:27:10,79
this attribute because this is already a

5746
03:27:08,719 --> 03:27:12,639
published event

5747
03:27:10,79 --> 03:27:14,159
now it looks like our event is empty but

5748
03:27:12,639 --> 03:27:15,519
if you look at the deleted flag you will

5749
03:27:14,159 --> 03:27:16,318
see that the sensitive attribute is

5750
03:27:15,520 --> 03:27:18,479
still there

5751
03:27:16,318 --> 03:27:20,478
and if i were to publish the event now

5752
03:27:18,478 --> 03:27:22,0
12438.479 --> 12442
this sensitive attribute would

5753
03:27:20,478 --> 03:27:25,39
it would get propagated along with the

5754
03:27:22,0 --> 03:27:27,359
12442 --> 12447.359
event if you want to avoid this

5755
03:27:25,40 --> 03:27:29,200
altogether there is a way to mangle any

5756
03:27:27,359 --> 03:27:31,680
attribute that gets self-deleted

5757
03:27:29,200 --> 03:27:32,800
what happens in that case is a category

5758
03:27:31,680 --> 03:27:34,800
will be set to other

5759
03:27:32,799 --> 03:27:36,639
type will be set to other and value will

5760
03:27:34,799 --> 03:27:38,639
be set to redacted

5761
03:27:36,639 --> 03:27:39,920
this is a server-wide setting so your

5762
03:27:38,639 --> 03:27:41,519
administrator or if you are the

5763
03:27:39,920 --> 03:27:44,318
administrator and yourself can set this

5764
03:27:41,520 --> 03:27:46,159
setting in the server settings

5765
03:27:44,318 --> 03:27:47,519
the downside of that is if you are

5766
03:27:46,159 --> 03:27:49,200
mangling attributes that you're soft

5767
03:27:47,520 --> 03:27:51,279
deleting it will still inform the other

5768
03:27:49,200 --> 03:27:52,880
instances they will still

5769
03:27:51,279 --> 03:27:55,40
remove the data software the data

5770
03:27:52,879 --> 03:27:57,278
because the uid is reserved

5771
03:27:55,40 --> 03:27:58,239
however you cannot recover the attribute

5772
03:27:57,279 --> 03:28:00,238
anymore so if

5773
03:27:58,238 --> 03:28:01,760
so in this case right now we deleted

5774
03:28:00,238 --> 03:28:02,799
attribute alex could now click on the

5775
03:28:01,760 --> 03:28:04,639
recover button

5776
03:28:02,799 --> 03:28:06,79
and the attribute will be recovered as a

5777
03:28:04,639 --> 03:28:07,920
normal attribute so if you made a

5778
03:28:06,79 --> 03:28:11,39
mistake you can recover it

5779
03:28:07,920 --> 03:28:12,879
so there are two different mindsets i

5780
03:28:11,40 --> 03:28:14,960
want to make my data recoverable

5781
03:28:12,879 --> 03:28:17,278
versus and i want to always inform

5782
03:28:14,959 --> 03:28:20,79
others versus i want to always

5783
03:28:17,279 --> 03:28:21,359
hard delete data that i delete both of

5784
03:28:20,79 --> 03:28:23,520
them have a setting

5785
03:28:21,359 --> 03:28:25,40
so just pick and choose which whichever

5786
03:28:23,520 --> 03:28:27,680
makes sense for your community

5787
03:28:25,40 --> 03:28:28,479
whether you prefer secrecy or prefer

5788
03:28:27,680 --> 03:28:32,79
convenience

5789
03:28:28,478 --> 03:28:34,159
uh basically so it's basically

5790
03:28:32,79 --> 03:28:35,200
yeah that's delete for that review so if

5791
03:28:34,159 --> 03:28:38,318
we delete an

5792
03:28:35,200 --> 03:28:41,120
event that's another story yeah and this

5793
03:28:38,318 --> 03:28:42,398
this one is interesting because now we

5794
03:28:41,120 --> 03:28:44,640
have these options where we say

5795
03:28:42,398 --> 03:28:46,79
i want to delete this event and

5796
03:28:44,639 --> 03:28:46,799
obviously it will be deleted on your

5797
03:28:46,79 --> 03:28:49,200
instance

5798
03:28:46,799 --> 03:28:50,159
nevertheless this even has been already

5799
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:52,159
synchronized

5800
03:28:50,159 --> 03:28:53,200
copy and develop different misc

5801
03:28:52,159 --> 03:28:54,398
instances

5802
03:28:53,200 --> 03:28:56,239
so that means as the next

5803
03:28:54,398 --> 03:28:57,39
synchronizations the event should be

5804
03:28:56,238 --> 03:28:59,920
pulled

5805
03:28:57,40 --> 03:29:01,680
but to avoid such kind of of issue mist

5806
03:28:59,920 --> 03:29:05,520
is automatically generating

5807
03:29:01,680 --> 03:29:07,359
a block list of all those elite events

5808
03:29:05,520 --> 03:29:09,600
so if you are the administrator you can

5809
03:29:07,359 --> 03:29:12,238
see at the block list of events

5810
03:29:09,600 --> 03:29:13,120
you can see the the one that i just

5811
03:29:12,238 --> 03:29:16,238
deleted

5812
03:29:13,120 --> 03:29:18,720
so why we do that it's very simple

5813
03:29:16,238 --> 03:29:20,238
we don't want to re-import the event

5814
03:29:18,719 --> 03:29:21,358
that has been deleted because luckily we

5815
03:29:20,238 --> 03:29:23,680
don't want this event

5816
03:29:21,359 --> 03:29:25,520
so it's a it's a block list of all the

5817
03:29:23,680 --> 03:29:28,720
cgas

5818
03:29:25,520 --> 03:29:30,399
but this this catch there uh sometimes

5819
03:29:28,719 --> 03:29:31,760
we have people oh i'm doing some tests

5820
03:29:30,398 --> 03:29:33,439
and so on i'm synchronizing with miss

5821
03:29:31,760 --> 03:29:35,439
but i can't see my even back

5822
03:29:33,439 --> 03:29:36,479
and obviously yes because it's there in

5823
03:29:35,439 --> 03:29:37,840
this block list

5824
03:29:36,478 --> 03:29:39,358
so if you have some tests and you're

5825
03:29:37,840 --> 03:29:40,398
running some tests don't forget to look

5826
03:29:39,359 --> 03:29:44,159
at the block list

5827
03:29:40,398 --> 03:29:46,318
and maybe you want to just remove

5828
03:29:44,159 --> 03:29:48,719
the event for the block keys and then

5829
03:29:46,318 --> 03:29:50,478
you can synchronize back the event

5830
03:29:48,719 --> 03:29:52,559
there's something to keep in mind it's

5831
03:29:50,478 --> 03:29:54,79
there it's done automatically but in

5832
03:29:52,559 --> 03:29:54,799
some cases you want to manage the

5833
03:29:54,79 --> 03:29:58,0
12594.08 --> 12598
blockly

5834
03:29:54,799 --> 03:30:01,519
so that's something to keep in mind

5835
03:29:58,0 --> 03:30:04,478
12598 --> 12604.479
yep something else

5836
03:30:01,520 --> 03:30:06,79
that we perhaps should uh touch on here

5837
03:30:04,478 --> 03:30:08,799
is is

5838
03:30:06,79 --> 03:30:09,760
for the event deletions besides just a

5839
03:30:08,799 --> 03:30:11,119
blockless part

5840
03:30:09,760 --> 03:30:12,800
there is one thing that comes up as a

5841
03:30:11,120 --> 03:30:15,40
question very often is how do i inform

5842
03:30:12,799 --> 03:30:16,639
others that an event needs to be removed

5843
03:30:15,40 --> 03:30:19,40
we don't have a mechanism in place for

5844
03:30:16,639 --> 03:30:21,519
that so while we can revoke attributes

5845
03:30:19,40 --> 03:30:23,120
for events uh we don't have that and

5846
03:30:21,520 --> 03:30:25,279
there's a reason for that

5847
03:30:23,120 --> 03:30:26,239
in general uh whenever it comes to

5848
03:30:25,279 --> 03:30:29,200
events uh

5849
03:30:26,238 --> 03:30:30,639
we don't want to give the power to just

5850
03:30:29,200 --> 03:30:33,439
outright delete

5851
03:30:30,639 --> 03:30:34,719
events uh remotely this way so this

5852
03:30:33,439 --> 03:30:36,238
might change in the future

5853
03:30:34,719 --> 03:30:37,920
we we're having discussions on that

5854
03:30:36,238 --> 03:30:40,79
whether we want to enable that or not

5855
03:30:37,920 --> 03:30:41,840
but currently that's not the case yeah

5856
03:30:40,79 --> 03:30:44,398
and usually we take as an example

5857
03:30:41,840 --> 03:30:46,0
12641.84 --> 12646
emails i mean you can remove emails from

5858
03:30:44,398 --> 03:30:47,358
your personal mailbox but from the

5859
03:30:46,0 --> 03:30:49,120
12646 --> 12649.12
remote mailbox if someone already

5860
03:30:47,359 --> 03:30:51,279
receives the emails

5861
03:30:49,120 --> 03:30:53,120
you want to have the control over third

5862
03:30:51,279 --> 03:30:58,79
parties on the mailbox that

5863
03:30:53,120 --> 03:31:00,239
might be one of the drawback i would say

5864
03:30:58,79 --> 03:31:01,760
so there are two two new questions one

5865
03:31:00,238 --> 03:31:03,439
of them is basically can you demonstrate

5866
03:31:01,760 --> 03:31:05,200
the progressive enrichments of events

5867
03:31:03,439 --> 03:31:06,559
by the shared communities over time with

5868
03:31:05,200 --> 03:31:08,960
correlations

5869
03:31:06,559 --> 03:31:10,398
this one is tough i mean i'm not sure

5870
03:31:08,959 --> 03:31:11,278
how we could demonstrate that because

5871
03:31:10,398 --> 03:31:14,159
we're not dealing with

5872
03:31:11,279 --> 03:31:14,560
live instances with live data sets and

5873
03:31:14,159 --> 03:31:17,279
act

5874
03:31:14,559 --> 03:31:17,278
active sharing

5875
03:31:17,840 --> 03:31:23,40
but perhaps for tomorrow we will prepare

5876
03:31:19,680 --> 03:31:25,520
an example where we can show it off

5877
03:31:23,40 --> 03:31:28,640
when and choose an event that we can

5878
03:31:25,520 --> 03:31:31,120
show on one of the operational instances

5879
03:31:28,639 --> 03:31:33,119
but i i can't show one on uh you know

5880
03:31:31,120 --> 03:31:36,560
what i can't go on

5881
03:31:33,120 --> 03:31:38,79
just one thing i'm i'm going on an

5882
03:31:36,559 --> 03:31:41,760
instance

5883
03:31:38,79 --> 03:31:43,760
okay so so it was

5884
03:31:41,760 --> 03:31:45,200
oh we are flexible so it's not super fun

5885
03:31:43,760 --> 03:31:48,318
to do it no but

5886
03:31:45,200 --> 03:31:49,359
um so it's maybe some some something

5887
03:31:48,318 --> 03:31:52,0
12708.319 --> 12712
interesting there

5888
03:31:49,359 --> 03:31:52,720
um so um i'm connecting an instance

5889
03:31:52,0 --> 03:31:55,760
12712 --> 12715.76
where i have

5890
03:31:52,719 --> 03:31:57,278
more expansion services uh active and so

5891
03:31:55,760 --> 03:31:59,200
on

5892
03:31:57,279 --> 03:32:01,40
i'll just keep it for my organization

5893
03:31:59,200 --> 03:32:05,520
only so i'm creating

5894
03:32:01,40 --> 03:32:07,600
an event there so what happens on

5895
03:32:05,520 --> 03:32:08,960
progressively enriching even by shared

5896
03:32:07,600 --> 03:32:10,479
communities i mean

5897
03:32:08,959 --> 03:32:12,159
it's going back and forth to different

5898
03:32:10,478 --> 03:32:14,559
communities but i can i can imitate what

5899
03:32:12,159 --> 03:32:18,159
the community is doing usually

5900
03:32:14,559 --> 03:32:21,600
so if i'm facing an attribute

5901
03:32:18,159 --> 03:32:26,398
for example i will i will say it

5902
03:32:21,600 --> 03:32:26,399
hostname with some network activity

5903
03:32:32,959 --> 03:32:36,879
so we have specifically a test that we

5904
03:32:35,680 --> 03:32:39,439
created with this

5905
03:32:36,879 --> 03:32:40,559
kind of thing so what would be your

5906
03:32:39,439 --> 03:32:41,920
community and

5907
03:32:40,559 --> 03:32:43,600
sharing so it could be for example in

5908
03:32:41,920 --> 03:32:45,680
the same organization in my case it's

5909
03:32:43,600 --> 03:32:48,800
just clear to the organization so

5910
03:32:45,680 --> 03:32:50,0
12765.68 --> 12770
if i publish event here it will be

5911
03:32:48,799 --> 03:32:51,519
shared with

5912
03:32:50,0 --> 03:32:53,520
12770 --> 12773.52
all different instances maybe the

5913
03:32:51,520 --> 03:32:57,680
different members of circle

5914
03:32:53,520 --> 03:33:01,840
uh and um one of my colleagues

5915
03:32:57,680 --> 03:33:04,720
is taking one of the indicators

5916
03:33:01,840 --> 03:33:05,760
and then he's going on the far side

5917
03:33:04,719 --> 03:33:07,599
database

5918
03:33:05,760 --> 03:33:09,120
doing a full-blown expansion so that

5919
03:33:07,600 --> 03:33:10,159
means he's basically doing a full-bone

5920
03:33:09,120 --> 03:33:13,760
extension

5921
03:33:10,159 --> 03:33:16,959
um what do i have here i have a

5922
03:33:13,760 --> 03:33:18,719
a complete set of objects for a specific

5923
03:33:16,959 --> 03:33:22,318
domain so you see again

5924
03:33:18,719 --> 03:33:25,39
i'm going to the event graph

5925
03:33:22,318 --> 03:33:25,680
now i enter my domain name and i have

5926
03:33:25,40 --> 03:33:27,359
all the

5927
03:33:25,680 --> 03:33:28,960
passive dns free curve associated to

5928
03:33:27,359 --> 03:33:31,760
that one

5929
03:33:28,959 --> 03:33:33,199
and in this one i think i will have the

5930
03:33:31,760 --> 03:33:35,520
even timeline i have a completely

5931
03:33:33,200 --> 03:33:38,960
different timeline of the different uh

5932
03:33:35,520 --> 03:33:42,238
expansion and so on so then i will have

5933
03:33:38,959 --> 03:33:42,879
one of my i will it will be published

5934
03:33:42,238 --> 03:33:45,209
again

5935
03:33:42,879 --> 03:33:46,719
with the uh with the data

5936
03:33:45,209 --> 03:33:48,879
[Music]

5937
03:33:46,719 --> 03:33:50,79
if it's a collaboration i would say in

5938
03:33:48,879 --> 03:33:52,799
the same team

5939
03:33:50,79 --> 03:33:53,359
that's a thing so it's sometimes it's

5940
03:33:52,799 --> 03:33:55,119
it's

5941
03:33:53,359 --> 03:33:57,439
people are working on the same event and

5942
03:33:55,120 --> 03:33:59,359
publishing it sometimes they are

5943
03:33:57,439 --> 03:34:01,359
sharing it and doing additional

5944
03:33:59,359 --> 03:34:04,880
expansion on the uh

5945
03:34:01,359 --> 03:34:08,79
on the um things until to reach a

5946
03:34:04,879 --> 03:34:11,39
specific point that is like i would say

5947
03:34:08,79 --> 03:34:12,398
accessible or at least publishable in a

5948
03:34:11,40 --> 03:34:16,0
12851.04 --> 12856
publishing state that is

5949
03:34:12,398 --> 03:34:18,318
acceptable by various people

5950
03:34:16,0 --> 03:34:19,520
12856 --> 12859.52
now we can make proposal too so that

5951
03:34:18,318 --> 03:34:22,79
means

5952
03:34:19,520 --> 03:34:24,880
if we are again on a different with a

5953
03:34:22,79 --> 03:34:26,478
different organization

5954
03:34:24,879 --> 03:34:28,79
i don't know if in this example it will

5955
03:34:26,478 --> 03:34:30,719
work but i can

5956
03:34:28,79 --> 03:34:32,879
take do i have something interesting

5957
03:34:30,719 --> 03:34:32,879
there

5958
03:34:33,760 --> 03:34:37,680
yeah for example i see an interesting

5959
03:34:35,359 --> 03:34:37,680
ipl

5960
03:34:37,840 --> 03:34:43,840
this one so what i could do is

5961
03:34:41,279 --> 03:34:43,840
i could

5962
03:34:44,398 --> 03:34:46,719
add

5963
03:34:49,600 --> 03:34:52,479
what's going on here

5964
03:34:53,40 --> 03:34:57,40
i will add what

5965
03:35:04,159 --> 03:35:14,0
12904.16 --> 12914
okay just a demo effect

5966
03:35:10,799 --> 03:35:18,238
it's a great typical

5967
03:35:14,0 --> 03:35:18,238
12914 --> 12918.239
what's going on here okay

5968
03:35:19,439 --> 03:35:25,40
just going back to this one i just want

5969
03:35:21,600 --> 03:35:28,0
12921.6 --> 12928
to add a proposal

5970
03:35:25,40 --> 03:35:28,0
12925.04 --> 12928
yes i cannot just

5971
03:35:28,959 --> 03:35:35,839
you wanted but your admin yeah

5972
03:35:33,200 --> 03:35:36,479
yeah then i don't you can cheat whether

5973
03:35:35,840 --> 03:35:38,478
you

5974
03:35:36,478 --> 03:35:40,0
12936.479 --> 12940
really want you can do it yeah wait fine

5975
03:35:38,478 --> 03:35:43,39
it's just like okay so

5976
03:35:40,0 --> 03:35:44,799
12940 --> 12944.8
i i don't know for for hong kong if we

5977
03:35:43,40 --> 03:35:47,840
answer your question but i mean

5978
03:35:44,799 --> 03:35:49,519
a full-blown step would be like that if

5979
03:35:47,840 --> 03:35:50,559
you work on an event it's not a single

5980
03:35:49,520 --> 03:35:52,399
person obviously

5981
03:35:50,559 --> 03:35:54,238
when you do an investigation you do like

5982
03:35:52,398 --> 03:35:54,799
multiple steps but the question is more

5983
03:35:54,238 --> 03:35:56,879
like

5984
03:35:54,799 --> 03:35:58,799
if you do it within a team usually you

5985
03:35:56,879 --> 03:36:00,0
12956.88 --> 12960
edit the current even the same

5986
03:35:58,799 --> 03:36:03,519
organizations

5987
03:36:00,0 --> 03:36:05,760
12960 --> 12965.76
if you do enter team you do proposal

5988
03:36:03,520 --> 03:36:07,680
extend it even like we showed before and

5989
03:36:05,760 --> 03:36:09,359
then you start to work on this uh

5990
03:36:07,680 --> 03:36:11,279
thing so it's here depending on the case

5991
03:36:09,359 --> 03:36:13,600
so uh

5992
03:36:11,279 --> 03:36:15,680
so i hope you can you can you can see

5993
03:36:13,600 --> 03:36:18,318
what are the capabilities there but it's

5994
03:36:15,680 --> 03:36:20,398
really uh the progressive approach of

5995
03:36:18,318 --> 03:36:22,559
collaboration usually depends of

5996
03:36:20,398 --> 03:36:24,478
how people are working together if they

5997
03:36:22,559 --> 03:36:25,680
are really external it's more proposal

5998
03:36:24,478 --> 03:36:28,79
extended event

5999
03:36:25,680 --> 03:36:29,279
if it's within the same team it could be

6000
03:36:28,79 --> 03:36:31,439
extended event

6001
03:36:29,279 --> 03:36:33,920
or within the same event that's usually

6002
03:36:31,439 --> 03:36:37,120
the two way of working

6003
03:36:33,920 --> 03:36:39,680
if you want to add something no yeah

6004
03:36:37,120 --> 03:36:39,680
that's perfect

6005
03:36:39,760 --> 03:36:43,279
perhaps another question if you're okay

6006
03:36:42,639 --> 03:36:46,719
with

6007
03:36:43,279 --> 03:36:48,0
13003.279 --> 13008
switching yeah when speaking of feeding

6008
03:36:46,719 --> 03:36:49,840
tools what would be the automatic

6009
03:36:48,0 --> 03:36:51,120
13008 --> 13011.12
way of doing it so normally when we're

6010
03:36:49,840 --> 03:36:52,639
talking about feeding tools there are

6011
03:36:51,120 --> 03:36:54,720
two separate ways of doing it and we'll

6012
03:36:52,639 --> 03:36:56,159
go way way deeper into this tomorrow

6013
03:36:54,719 --> 03:36:58,238
when we talk about integration but

6014
03:36:56,159 --> 03:36:58,959
generally tools can either fetch data

6015
03:36:58,238 --> 03:37:00,559
from miss

6016
03:36:58,959 --> 03:37:02,799
so this is a more common way where a

6017
03:37:00,559 --> 03:37:05,119
tool would use rest search api that we

6018
03:37:02,799 --> 03:37:07,278
mentioned before where you define yours

6019
03:37:05,120 --> 03:37:09,40
your search patterns for example give me

6020
03:37:07,279 --> 03:37:12,159
everything that is newer than

6021
03:37:09,40 --> 03:37:12,880
30 days everything that uh that contains

6022
03:37:12,159 --> 03:37:15,760
at least

6023
03:37:12,879 --> 03:37:16,398
that is not coming from say oh since the

6024
03:37:15,760 --> 03:37:18,719
sources

6025
03:37:16,398 --> 03:37:19,599
or perhaps not something nothing that

6026
03:37:18,719 --> 03:37:21,760
comes

6027
03:37:19,600 --> 03:37:23,520
uh related to a certain topic for

6028
03:37:21,760 --> 03:37:25,600
example i'm not interested in ransomware

6029
03:37:23,520 --> 03:37:26,399
when feeding my tools just a stupid

6030
03:37:25,600 --> 03:37:28,640
example

6031
03:37:26,398 --> 03:37:30,159
so you set up your filter options and

6032
03:37:28,639 --> 03:37:32,318
then your tool would fetch

6033
03:37:30,159 --> 03:37:33,680
data from misp every 60 minutes for

6034
03:37:32,318 --> 03:37:36,159
example

6035
03:37:33,680 --> 03:37:37,359
and then replace the data set there you

6036
03:37:36,159 --> 03:37:40,318
can also do

6037
03:37:37,359 --> 03:37:42,79
sliding time window searches where you

6038
03:37:40,318 --> 03:37:43,760
say give me everything from the past 60

6039
03:37:42,79 --> 03:37:45,359
minutes that is new

6040
03:37:43,760 --> 03:37:48,0
13063.76 --> 13068
and then you keep concatenating your

6041
03:37:45,359 --> 03:37:49,40
data set on the seam side ids side

6042
03:37:48,0 --> 03:37:51,200
13068 --> 13071.2
whatever tool you're

6043
03:37:49,40 --> 03:37:52,880
feeding the alternative if you want to

6044
03:37:51,200 --> 03:37:53,680
have the data push automatically as it

6045
03:37:52,879 --> 03:37:55,199
comes in

6046
03:37:53,680 --> 03:37:57,40
you have different channels and mist

6047
03:37:55,200 --> 03:37:58,560
that your tools can latch on to

6048
03:37:57,40 --> 03:38:00,720
the downside being that you still need

6049
03:37:58,559 --> 03:38:03,199
to do the conversion

6050
03:38:00,719 --> 03:38:04,959
in those cases so if you were not using

6051
03:38:03,200 --> 03:38:08,159
the

6052
03:38:04,959 --> 03:38:11,199
the apis to fetch the data from bisp

6053
03:38:08,159 --> 03:38:11,680
then mis can push using the miss json

6054
03:38:11,200 --> 03:38:13,680
format

6055
03:38:11,680 --> 03:38:16,0
13091.68 --> 13096
data down via different channels serum

6056
03:38:13,680 --> 03:38:16,0
13093.68 --> 13096
queue

6057
03:38:16,79 --> 03:38:19,760
or the kafka channel or this blog and so

6058
03:38:19,279 --> 03:38:21,279
on

6059
03:38:19,760 --> 03:38:23,40
and then your tools automatically feed

6060
03:38:21,279 --> 03:38:24,0
13101.279 --> 13104
on that data so you have these two

6061
03:38:23,40 --> 03:38:26,399
different

6062
03:38:24,0 --> 03:38:27,520
13104 --> 13107.52
ways of interacting with it there's also

6063
03:38:26,398 --> 03:38:28,959
a third way

6064
03:38:27,520 --> 03:38:31,760
where you can basically either build an

6065
03:38:28,959 --> 03:38:34,0
13108.96 --> 13114
export module or an enrichment module

6066
03:38:31,760 --> 03:38:35,760
where an analyst can trigger a direct

6067
03:38:34,0 --> 03:38:38,559
13114 --> 13118.56
push of a certain data point

6068
03:38:35,760 --> 03:38:39,920
to another tool so that's another option

6069
03:38:38,559 --> 03:38:41,840
we'll talk about these different

6070
03:38:39,920 --> 03:38:45,199
strategies when to use which

6071
03:38:41,840 --> 03:38:49,199
which and how to mix those tomorrow more

6072
03:38:45,199 --> 03:38:52,399
so i hope that answers it in a

6073
03:38:49,199 --> 03:38:54,159
brief fashion yeah what i'm showing here

6074
03:38:52,398 --> 03:38:57,840
is it's just like

6075
03:38:54,159 --> 03:38:59,359
on the on the rest uh search client

6076
03:38:57,840 --> 03:39:01,760
for example you want to feed your your

6077
03:38:59,359 --> 03:39:04,800
storikata and so on uh just

6078
03:39:01,760 --> 03:39:09,840
take page um

6079
03:39:04,799 --> 03:39:09,840
on a specific limit

6080
03:39:13,359 --> 03:39:17,199
so what you can do is if you have a

6081
03:39:15,600 --> 03:39:19,120
python script and so on you can pull

6082
03:39:17,199 --> 03:39:22,159
directly the data so

6083
03:39:19,120 --> 03:39:23,199
the rest client so you see in this case

6084
03:39:22,159 --> 03:39:26,159
i have the

6085
03:39:23,199 --> 03:39:26,880
shurikata rule set but if you want to

6086
03:39:26,159 --> 03:39:29,359
feed your

6087
03:39:26,879 --> 03:39:31,358
specific tools and and so on uh

6088
03:39:29,359 --> 03:39:34,960
automatically we are generating

6089
03:39:31,359 --> 03:39:36,399
uh curl and python card so it could be a

6090
03:39:34,959 --> 03:39:38,639
bootstrap to see okay

6091
03:39:36,398 --> 03:39:41,119
how should i create my own tool for

6092
03:39:38,639 --> 03:39:42,639
feeding my ideas and so on uh for for

6093
03:39:41,120 --> 03:39:44,399
study cata for example

6094
03:39:42,639 --> 03:39:45,840
a lot of management interface have

6095
03:39:44,398 --> 03:39:47,760
already missed connector

6096
03:39:45,840 --> 03:39:49,120
so you can even like feed the data

6097
03:39:47,760 --> 03:39:51,600
directly from

6098
03:39:49,120 --> 03:39:52,319
the from the interface if they have the

6099
03:39:51,600 --> 03:39:54,720
ability

6100
03:39:52,318 --> 03:39:56,639
splunk for example there's a specific

6101
03:39:54,719 --> 03:40:00,79
application

6102
03:39:56,639 --> 03:40:02,799
which is an external tools part of the

6103
03:40:00,79 --> 03:40:04,79
app store of splunk that you can install

6104
03:40:02,799 --> 03:40:05,759
for doing the connection

6105
03:40:04,79 --> 03:40:08,639
and some other people are using their

6106
03:40:05,760 --> 03:40:12,159
own python script to feed other cm

6107
03:40:08,639 --> 03:40:14,238
so again it's a matter of taste

6108
03:40:12,159 --> 03:40:16,0
13212.16 --> 13216
if you are curious about the different

6109
03:40:14,238 --> 03:40:18,79
kind of integrations

6110
03:40:16,0 --> 03:40:20,79
13216 --> 13220.08
or you can do it in python for example

6111
03:40:18,79 --> 03:40:24,79
in on payments

6112
03:40:20,79 --> 03:40:26,478
itself there are plenty of examples

6113
03:40:24,79 --> 03:40:28,959
so if you go in the example directory of

6114
03:40:26,478 --> 03:40:28,959
palmist

6115
03:40:30,799 --> 03:40:38,0
13230.8 --> 13238
you have a quite significant

6116
03:40:34,799 --> 03:40:41,438
set of default scripts

6117
03:40:38,0 --> 03:40:43,40
13238 --> 13243.04
that you can use uh and that's uh

6118
03:40:41,439 --> 03:40:46,159
i think usually a good basis if you want

6119
03:40:43,40 --> 03:40:48,720
to start to to write your own custom

6120
03:40:46,159 --> 03:40:49,520
custom tool set for for feeding your

6121
03:40:48,719 --> 03:40:51,278
feeding

6122
03:40:49,520 --> 03:40:53,920
systems or existing software in your

6123
03:40:51,279 --> 03:40:53,920
infrastructure

6124
03:40:57,199 --> 03:41:03,760
yep um

6125
03:41:01,680 --> 03:41:05,359
i don't know if it's if we should jump

6126
03:41:03,760 --> 03:41:07,600
on a new topic or we just push the

6127
03:41:05,359 --> 03:41:10,479
copalos example for tomorrow

6128
03:41:07,600 --> 03:41:12,79
yeah i think i think uh we can we can do

6129
03:41:10,478 --> 03:41:14,398
it maybe tomorrow i think

6130
03:41:12,79 --> 03:41:15,920
if we can i think that would be

6131
03:41:14,398 --> 03:41:17,519
stretching it a little bit if we were to

6132
03:41:15,920 --> 03:41:21,40
start with that yeah

6133
03:41:17,520 --> 03:41:22,0
13277.52 --> 13282
so um quick quick summary of today so

6134
03:41:21,40 --> 03:41:25,40
today we we

6135
03:41:22,0 --> 03:41:26,79
13282 --> 13286.08
show uh how to create an event the basis

6136
03:41:25,40 --> 03:41:28,319
of misplay

6137
03:41:26,79 --> 03:41:29,840
what is an attribute an object and so on

6138
03:41:28,318 --> 03:41:32,959
how to create it so to

6139
03:41:29,840 --> 03:41:34,79
make proposal delete uh and and and

6140
03:41:32,959 --> 03:41:36,238
stuff like that

6141
03:41:34,79 --> 03:41:37,840
so it's really a simple example tomorrow

6142
03:41:36,238 --> 03:41:40,639
we want to show you

6143
03:41:37,840 --> 03:41:42,639
more the uh even report aspect and the

6144
03:41:40,639 --> 03:41:45,439
automatic imports into

6145
03:41:42,639 --> 03:41:46,879
into mist with a practical example of an

6146
03:41:45,439 --> 03:41:49,920
ocean report

6147
03:41:46,879 --> 03:41:51,438
and we will discuss tomorrow about

6148
03:41:49,920 --> 03:41:53,40
how to build sharing communities and

6149
03:41:51,439 --> 03:41:55,840
especially we will share

6150
03:41:53,40 --> 03:41:57,279
our experience of things that worked and

6151
03:41:55,840 --> 03:41:59,520
things that didn't work

6152
03:41:57,279 --> 03:42:01,359
uh in the past years when creating

6153
03:41:59,520 --> 03:42:03,40
sharing communities so if you are

6154
03:42:01,359 --> 03:42:04,479
isaac members or creating your own

6155
03:42:03,40 --> 03:42:05,600
sharing community even within your

6156
03:42:04,478 --> 03:42:07,39
organization

6157
03:42:05,600 --> 03:42:09,40
uh it's it's something good to

6158
03:42:07,40 --> 03:42:10,560
participate because you we will share

6159
03:42:09,40 --> 03:42:12,479
with you some some of the things that

6160
03:42:10,559 --> 03:42:14,238
are interesting of building a

6161
03:42:12,478 --> 03:42:17,519
bootstrapping such kind of

6162
03:42:14,238 --> 03:42:19,279
of community um

6163
03:42:17,520 --> 03:42:20,800
i don't know honestly you want to add

6164
03:42:19,279 --> 03:42:24,319
something no

6165
03:42:20,799 --> 03:42:25,920
and that's basically it thanks for

6166
03:42:24,318 --> 03:42:27,278
everyone for sticking through

6167
03:42:25,920 --> 03:42:29,120
through this it's a very condensed

6168
03:42:27,279 --> 03:42:30,880
session so

6169
03:42:29,120 --> 03:42:32,560
we said we didn't make as much progress

6170
03:42:30,879 --> 03:42:33,920
as we hoped so we have quite a bit left

6171
03:42:32,559 --> 03:42:37,198
for tomorrow

6172
03:42:33,920 --> 03:42:39,120
and hope to see you all here tomorrow

6173
03:42:37,199 --> 03:42:40,800
thank you very much uh take care and

6174
03:42:39,120 --> 03:42:43,279
don't hesitate to ask questions

6175
03:42:40,799 --> 03:42:44,318
uh either later on directly contact us

6176
03:42:43,279 --> 03:42:48,79
thank you very much

6177
03:42:44,318 --> 03:42:48,79
see you tomorrow thank you all see you

6178
03:42:49,318 --> 03:42:52,318
tomorrow
