  \frametitle{What is a MISP Galaxy?}
  \begin{itemize}
	  \item MISP Galaxy is a feature in MISP and a MISP standard\footnote{\url{https://www.misp-standard.org/}} format to create {\bf contextualization libraries}.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item There are two main types: \textbf{combined list} or \textbf{matrix-like list}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The first historical matrix-like galaxy was MITRE ATT\&CK\footnote{Presented at the first EU ATT\&CK community meeting in Luxembourg}.
    \item Galaxies contain intelligence that can be \textbf{structured} in a matrix-like format. Relationships between models can be created, and implementation such as in MISP allows for the \textbf{forking and sharing of information}. This is typically attached to intelligence in threat intelligence platforms to add context.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
   \frametitle{Origins and Evolution}
   \begin{itemize}
       \item Seeing the success of the ATT\&CK framework in MISP gave rise to a host of matrix-based models:
       \begin{itemize}
           \item Inflation? We don’t think so. There are {\bf different models} because there are many {\bf different use cases to be represented}.
           \item We found this to be good as long as those models are maintained.
       \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

        \frametitle{What Leads to Starting New Frameworks?}
        \begin{itemize}
	\item New frameworks try to {\bf fill gaps}.
            \item New ideas in different areas/domains.
            \item Small vs. large initiatives.
	    \item {\bf Collaboration is not always easy}.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Small contributors vs. large organizations.
                    \item Absence of guidance to contribute.
                    \item Closed models.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Research \& publication vs. practical use.
            \item Need for timely new data in a continuously evolving threat landscape.
        \end{itemize}

        \frametitle{Conversion (or the Dirty Part)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Understand the topic.
            \item Understand the users and their use cases.
            \item Map to Matrix / Kill Chain.
            \item Handle \textbf{various formats}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item JSON, XLS, PDF, DOCX, Markdown, CSV, web scraping, Python, etc.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Reverse engineer the data model.
            \item Manage UUIDs: existing vs. generating new.
            \item Handle duplicate values\footnote{In other words, many organizations didn’t machine-validate their own model.}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Interaction with the framework owner.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Create the conversion script.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Relations (Where Are the Overlaps?)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example relations: \texttt{similar}, \texttt{contains}, or lifecycle: \texttt{revoked-by}.
            \item Frameworks might contain internal relations.
            \item Relations between different frameworks:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Native relationships}
                \item \textbf{3rd party contributions}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Create specific tooling to help or partially automate the creation of relations.
        \end{itemize}

        \frametitle{Maintenance (Anyone on the Line?)}
        \begin{itemize}
		\item {\bf Frameworks have a lifecycle} - evolution of the model.
            \item Know when there is an update.
	    \item {\bf Deprecate, revoke, delete entries}.
            \item Change of UUID (UUIDv4 or UUIDv5) / value - may impact UUID.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Breaks relationships with UUIDs.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Conversion script breaks.
            \item Keeping contributed relationships.
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Opportunities (How Can It Help Me?)}
        \begin{itemize}
		\item Structure new models: {\bf Understand existing ones to identify gaps} and raise feature requests or pull requests on \texttt{misp-galaxy}.
            \item MISP Galaxy:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Open standard.
		    \item Data is CC0 - {\bf reusable in any software}.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Extend frameworks: Use one framework as a core library and build additional layers on top.
	    \item Marketing and promotion: The more tools that use it, the {\bf more widely the framework is adopted}.
        \end{itemize}
